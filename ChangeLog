	fixed previously, but the fix got undone prior to the release.  Thanks

	udisks2 and dbus are too shitty to be used on command-line).  Thanks to
	Tykin.

	Added FUSE_MOUNT3 filetype format, which is equivalent to FUSE_MOUNT, but

	providing a password.  Patch by zsugabubus.

	React to Enter in :media menu on device lines, mount on "not mounted" line

	Added v:servername variable, which provides access to server name of the
	running instance used by --remote feature.  Thanks to Marcin
	Kurczewski (a.k.a. rr-).

	Added dd key to :jobs menu, which requests cancellation of background
	operation.  Background :put, :copy, :move, :delete, size calculation with
	ga and gA as well as applications started in background can be cancelled
	this way.  Thanks to blurm.

	Enable cancellation of tree preview construction.  Thanks to filterfalse.

	Partially return progress report for menus.  Was disabled by introduction
	of null byte heuristic.

	Accept paths in :touch, not just file names.  Thanks to filterfalse.

	Consider trailing slash for directories or symbolic links that point to
	directories in 'classify' patterns by file name (e.g., this works now:
	`[::*/::]`).

	Do not resolve symbolic links in directory preview.  Thanks to
	filterfalse.

	getpanetype() got new value ("tree") to indicate tree-view.  Thanks to
	filterfalse.

	Read error output of background commands independently of main
	thread (prevents blocking of tools which produce huge amount of output).
	Thanks to Stas Malavin.

	Limited maximum height of message popup, just print how many lines we're
	skipping.

	No vifminfo merging if file change isn't detected.  Might result in faster
	quitting in some cases.  Not accounting for some changes is still possible
	when multiple instances quit simultaneously, but same could happen without
	this change.

	Improve performance of startup and exit by omitting file existence checks.
	The cost is possibly old files staying in the state, but it should be for
	long time.  Thanks to Marcin Kurczewski (a.k.a. rr-).

	which isn't always a reliable indication of actual permission error.  Only
	when 'syscalls' is on.  Thanks to Marcin Kurczewski (a.k.a. rr-).

	Improved sorting performance in the presence of huge amount of symbolic
	links.  Thanks to Marcin Kurczewski (a.k.a. rr-).

	obtained).

	Fixed buffer overflow on obtaining file mime-type.  Thanks to Abdó
	Roig-Maranges (a.k.a. aroig).

	Fixed previewing symbolic links, which not always were resolved to their
	target (even reachable one).  Thanks to Abdó Roig-Maranges (a.k.a. aroig).

	Fixed bogus "fuse mount was cancelled" message on %FOREGROUND mount
	failing.

	Fixed determining location of distributed files on Windows (help file and
	sample vifmrc weren't installed).  Thanks to r44083.

	options that are specific to current directory and are reset on directory
	change, similar to local options of Vim.

	Added zr normal mode key to reset local filter.  Thanks to filterfalse.

	Added named bookmarks (paths are associated with tags).  This adds :bmark,
	:bmarks, :bmgo and :delbmarks command-line commands.  Also there is new
	"bmarks" value for 'vifminfo'.  Thanks to Schmalzhaf Stefan.

	Added handling of dd in :trashes, :trashes? and :lstrashes, which either
	deletes an item in trash or empties trash.  Thanks to Svyatoslav
	Mishyn (a.k.a. juef).

	Added dynamic view column alignment (specified by "*", just like "-" for
	left alignment).  Patch by Cosmin Popescu (a.k.a. cosminadrianpopescu).

	names of currently running vifm servers and sets name of target/this
	instance respectively.

	Added optional %u and %U macros to 'findprg', 'grepprg', and 'locateprg'
	that allow immediate redirection of command output into custom view
	without opening a menu.  Thanks to filterfalse.

	Added builtin directory preview.  Thanks to Damian Ariel Perticone and
	Alexandre Viau.

	Added :pu[t] command that inserts files into current directory.  Thanks to

	Svyatoslav Mishyn (a.k.a. juef).

	Added 'dirsize' option to control how size of directories is displayed in

	Added handling of "%u" in trash specification on *nix, which is replaced
	with real user ID.  Thanks to Regis.

	Changed default value of 'trashdir' on *nix again, this time to
	"%r/.vifm-Trash-%u,$VIFM/Trash,%r/.vifm-Trash".  This way it's safer for
	privacy, although using %r is not very safe in general.  Thanks to Regis.

	Do not finish argument parsing after finding --help or --version,
	continue and validate the rest of command-line.  Thanks to Svyatoslav
	Mishyn (a.k.a. juef).

	Michael Vetter (a.k.a. jubalh).

	Document %= for 'statusline' and 'rulerformat'.

	Proper recovery from loading of color scheme unsupported by the terminal
	at startup.  Thanks to Svyatoslav Mishyn (a.k.a. juef).

	Automatically create ~/.vifm/scripts containing small README file if the
	directory doesn't exist on startup.  Thanks to fogine.

	Consider control message when deciding width for a dialog, also don't let
	it disappear on narrow terminals.

	Provide conflict resolution options in a dialog rather than on the
	command-line, which is hard to read with so many options.

	Choose "middle" of the list of even length closer to the top (M key).
	Thanks to Svyatoslav Mishyn (a.k.a. juef).

	Update cursor position on file disappearing in more predictable way.
	Use the closes file to the previously active one that still exists.
	Thanks to ranousse.

	Make :set, :filter and :normal zo (and alike) in vifmrc affect all views,
	thus obsoleting use of :winrun or :windo for this purpose (they still
	work, the new way is a simpler and more obvious one).  This is related to
	commands executed during vifmrc processing (not those in the right-hand
	side of mappings, commands, etc.).

	Display lower bound on item count in status bar progress messages (e.g. on
	:grep).

	juef).

	Check file system sensitivity on OS X.  Thanks to loongw.

	Allow 'shell' to specify a shell argument on *nix.  Thanks to loongw.

	Make "p" in 'tuioptions' affect padding in quick view and view mode.

	Documented difference between paths in menu with and without trailing
	slash.  Thanks to filterfalse.

	Save location before loading custom view into view directory history.
	Thanks to filterfalse.

	Invalidate directory size (calculated via ga/gA) if noticed that directory
	was changed.  This affects all parent directories as well, way easier to
	see what needs recalculation after file moving/removal.

	Ctrl-W | and Ctrl-W _ now can set window size to given count.  Thanks to
	filterfalse.

	Make sure confirmation dialog doesn't appear for background operations.

	Rewrote expression parser to prevent side-effects from occurring until
	syntax is checked.

	Put right-hand side of user-defined commands into separate scope of
	if-else-endif expressions.  This prevents affecting of regular input by
	malformed user-defined command.

	Fixed resetting "vborder" of 'fillchars' after it has been set to
	something (as in `:set fillchars=vborder:\* fillchars&`).

	Fixed crash after color scheme load failure possible in scenarios where
	file name specific highlights are used.

	Fixed use of uninitialized value which could affect whether pattern is
	matches whole path or only its name part.

	Fixed tests failures when run with root privileges.  Thanks to Ondrej
	Novy (a.k.a. onovy).

	Fixed running backgrounded commands with non-latin characters on
	Windows (that end with " &", should be OK to just drop it on Windows
	and get correct behaviour on 0.8).  Thanks to Stas Malavin.

	Fixed running of executables with spaces in paths on Windows with cmd.
	Thanks to Stas Malavin.

	Fixed choosing user vs. default shell on Windows (was reversed), related
	to %S, %i and alike macros.

	Fixed losing view sorting on failed attempt to load custom view.  Thanks
	to filterfalse.

	Fixed not restoring 'sort' value on leaving unsorted custom view.

	option.

	Fixed unintentional filters resetting on menu navigation to paths that
	have trailing slash.

	Fixed losing name of controlling terminal on reopening it.  Thanks to
	Dennis Hamester.

	version.  Thanks to Alexandre Viau.

	Fixed possible vifminfo shrinking (some data were removed from it) if an
	error occurs during initialization.

	Fixed highlight not being updated after file rename.

	Fixed possible hang during startup on Windows after removal of last

0.8-beta to 0.8 (2015-07-09)

	Added handling of Ctrl-L to sort dialog.  Thanks to filterfalse.

	Added device id (major and minor numbers) to file info dialog.

	Added script to update timestamps, so that build system won't be
	regenerated without real reason.  One might want to run it when building
	from git checkout, which doesn't preserve correct timestamps.

	Append unused space in view columns to the last one with percent sizing
	type if any.  Thanks to fogine.

	Drastically increased performance of custom view composing.

	Be more accurate when deciding whether view displays graphics,

	text viewers as well.  Thanks to Svyatoslav Mishyn (a.k.a. juef).

	Less flicker on preview window update.

	Clean occasional graphics leftovers after disabling preview.

	Ignore file decorations ('classify') on sorting custom views.  Thanks to
	filterfalse.

	Mishyn (a.k.a. juef).

	Disallow creating user-defined command with "?" or "!" suffix if this

	allowed, thus this shouldn't be allowed too.

	Better "all" pseudo-option parsing and support of resetting it.

	Do not display same path twice in detailed progress information (after
	both "file" and "from").

	Shorten paths in "file" and "from" in progress dialog.

	Sync approximate and accurate forms of progress dialogs.

	Fixed pane titles update on switching panes.

	Fixed build on OpenBSD.  Patch by Brian Callahan (a.k.a. ibara).

	Thanks to hofheinz.

	Fixed possible constant view reload when built on some systems.  Thanks to
	hofheinz.

	Fixed error reporting on builtin function argument parsing in rhs of :let
	expression.  Thanks to Svyatoslav Mishyn (a.k.a. juef).

	"!" or "?", which shouldn't be preferred over corresponding builtin
	abbreviation.

	Fixed "(n + 1) of n" in detailed progress dialog.

	Fixed infinite loop or crash on empty match on search in view mode (e.g.
	on /$).

	Fixed crash/leak on processing of background jobs.  Thanks to Christian
	Fillion (a.k.a. cfillion).

	Fixed several memory access errors and leaks.

0.7.8 to 0.8-beta (2015-06-19)

	Removed per-view last search pattern.  Don't worry, you probably won't

	one, which is hard to notice.

	Map <c-h> and <bs> to different key codes.  Thanks to fogine.

	Added <lt> angle bracket notation (less-than character, '<').  Thanks to

	Added 'chaselinks' option to automatically expand all symbolic links in
	path of a view (might not work on Windows).  Thanks to filterfalse.

	Added %FOREGROUND FUSE mounting option, which supersedes %CLEAR and
	fixes issue with passing input to FUSE mounter.  Thanks to Johannes (a.k.a.
	johannesmeng).

	Added %[ and %] macros for status line/ruler.  Thanks to ranousse.

	Added single-argument form of :file[x]type and :fileviewer commands that

	Hendrik Jaeger (a.k.a. henk) and Michael Maddern (a.k.a. madders).

	Added F key to less-like (file view) mode, which acts similar to `tail -F`
	or F key in less.  Thanks to Daniel Dettlaff (a.k.a. dmilith).

	Added 'mintimeout' option.  It enables controlling responsiveness on
	external events by Vifm.  Thanks to hofheinz.

	Added Ctrl-X / (slash) key to command-line mode that inserts last search
	pattern into current cursor position.  Thanks to filterfalse.

	Added custom views, which contrary to regular views can contain files that
	do not belong to the same directory.

	filtering out those that are not paths.

	Added zd normal and visual modes key to exclude items from custom views.

	Added %u and %U macros to redirect command output directly into custom
	view.  The second one allows for more customization of file list, which is
	absence of sorting for now.  Thanks to filterfalse.

	writing out list of paths (like on `-f` switch).  Thanks to Jeet
	Sukumaran (a.k.a. jeetsukumaran).

	output location for names of selected files or last visited directory
	respectively.  Thanks to Jeet Sukumaran (a.k.a. jeetsukumaran).

	its output.

	Added Ctrl-] command-line key to trigger abbreviation expansion.

	Added 'wordchars' option to specify which characters in command-line mode
	should be considered as part of a word.  Thanks to filterfalse.

	loonies).

	Added %px, %py, %pw and %ph macros that describe location and dimensions
	of preview area to use in external commands.  Thanks to Stephano (a.k.a.
	cao).

	astrell-root and astrell-user).  Thanks to astrell.

	Added regexp patterns to :file[x]type and :fileviewer commands.  Thanks to
	filterfalse.

	Added full path patterns ({{globs}} and //regexp//).  Thanks to astrell.

	Added detailed list of errors when 'syscalls' is used.  Thanks to willemw12.

	Added .vifm extension to color schemes (initial rename is performed
	automatically).  Thanks Michael Vetter (a.k.a. jubalh).

	Allowed having multiple file viewers with same rules for choosing them at
	run-time as for file associations.  Thanks to filterfalse.

	Added "p" to 'shortmess' option to control tilde shortening of paths in
	view titles.  Thanks to Martin Fischer.

	filterfalse.

	Auto-resize position field on the status bar to fit the text.  Thanks to

	to willemw12.

	Significantly reduced amount of work performed by Vifm in idle state.
	Thanks to hofheinz.

	Made message dialogs interact better with everything else on the screen.
	E.g. redraw properly after terminal resize.

	United last pattern of :substitute command with search history.  Thanks to
	filterfalse.

	Made configure script lookup curs_set in libtinfo.

	Redirect both standard output and error streams from viewers (already was
	the case for Windows).

	Don't lose previously saved filter on repeated resetting (pressing zO twice
	in a row caused previous filter values to be lost).

	Extended :sync command to support selective synchronization (user can
	choose among location, cursor position, local options and filters).
	Thanks to filterfalse.

	Automatically install sample vifmrc and help file on first start on

	filterfalse.

	Prevent inserting odd characters on terminal resize while in command-line
	mode.

	Throw away dead directories in directory histories on merging vifminfo
	files.  Otherwise clearing such directories on :history is almost useless.

	Display calculated size of directory for symbolic links that point to it.

	Handle commands that are too long to be passed directly to the shell by
	breaking them into list of arguments if possible.  Thanks to filterfalse.

	Install AUTHORS, COPYING, ChangeLog, INSTALL, NEWS, README and TODO to
	{prefix}/share/doc/vifm.  Install color schemes to
	{prefix}/share/vifm/colors.  Otherwise these are not available after
	installation.

	Break ties on case insensitive sort deterministically.

	Dynamic dialog dimensions (minimum %30 percent of the screen rather than
	screen-wide all the time).  Thanks to Svyatoslav Mishyn (a.k.a. juef).

	Try harder to start in valid directory (go upwards if last visited one
	doesn't have search permission) or leave the one that's not available
	anymore.

	Do not depend on UTF-8 locale on making plain text version of
	documentation.  Thanks to Svyatoslav Mishyn (a.k.a. juef).

	Normalized sorting keys/view column names: "type" -> "dir", display real
	mode in octal for "mode", make "type" actually display file type (as
	"mode" did before).  Thanks to Michal Belica (a.k.a. beli-sk).

	Complete `clear` subcommand of :highlight.

	Parse output of mandoc version of apropos in :apropos.  Thanks to Svyatoslav
	Mishyn (a.k.a. juef).

	Error on wrong combinations of macros and background mark in commands.

	No more unjustified inconsistency in processing macros in :! and
	:file[x]type commands.  Thanks to Miodrag Tokić (a.k.a. loonies).
