	Fixed treating a failure to create a trash directory on a read-only
	file-system in a Unix environment as a success.  Thanks to feekApp.

	Made documentation on which :commands can have comments a bit more
	verbose.

	Made `%i` keep access to the terminal instead of acting like `%i &` .

	Vifm Q2A site.

	Documented extra information on file copying.  Patch by EA1A87.

	Improved/extended/updated documentation on cancelling operations, compare
	and custom views.

	instead of getmntent() API).  The regression was apparently introduced in
	v0.9.1-beta.  Thanks to sublimal.

	Fixed a crash on drawing a tree-view when {ext} or {fileext} follows
	{name}, {iname}, {root} or {fileroot}.  Thanks to aw-cloud.

	martinengelke (a.k.a. sHii).

	Fixed :file[x]type commands being run in startup directory instead of
	view's directory when file was passed on command-line.  Thanks to
	ThePlaguebump.

	Improved documentation on zh/zl menu keys a bit.

	Corrected documentation on how the use of different preview macros affects
	classification of a previewer.

	Say "changed" when describing the meaning of "showdifferent" of :compare.
	Thanks to aleksejrs.

	Changed %N macro to not be mutually exclusive with most of other
	macros (the limitation wasn't documented and didn't make much sense).
	Thanks to James Dietrich.

	Changed handling of Ctrl-Z to not suspend the application if a

	not be executed (no branches taken).  Thanks to Ed Pavlov.

	Changed default value of 'findprg' to avoid the use of syntax specific to
	GNU find.  The only difference is that now one can see "Permission denied"
	errors which weren't displayed before.  Sample vifmrc files contain
	detection of GNU find on startup.  Thanks to Jose Riha (a.k.a. jose1711).

	Changed initialization to not create a copy of rendered man page at
	$VIFM/vifm-help.txt, :help now opens the original file.  Thanks to
	intelfx.

	passing it something like "15abc" will no longer be interpreted as 15.
	Thanks to MikeLemon.

	they are edited.

	Added WildBox highlight group.  It can be used to set background of
	completion window.

	strings in conditional expressions (e.g., `if $VAR` checks for `$VAR`
	being non empty instead of converting it to an integer).  Thanks to
	justpretending2.

	Added handling of Enter/Escape keys to prompts and error dialogs.  Thanks
	to laur89, Alexandre Viau and multiple other users who asked about this.

	variables in their place as a workaround.

	Added inode number to File Info dialog.

	fixed previously, but the fix got undone prior to the release.  Thanks

	up TUI, especially in combination with preview.  Thanks to ks1c.

	Do not complain about empty output of a graphics previewer for view mode.

	Upgraded to PDCurses 3.8 (was 3.4) for Windows.  This allows using 256
	colors inside ConEmu.  Note that ConEmu has issues processing 256 colors
	on the last line of the screen, so avoid using them for status line.

	providing a password.  Patch by zsugabubus.

	React to Enter in :media menu on device lines, mount on "not mounted" line

	operated on contain symlinks.  Resolve to real paths before computing

	won't be called, due to existence of a builtin that accepts custom
	separators (they have higher priority than user-defined commands).

	Issue a warning if file system lists several files with identical names in
	the same directory.  It used to be assumed that it can't happen.  Thanks to
	Jose Riha (a.k.a. jose1711).

	be about seven times faster by avoiding reinitialization of the library).

	Don't force file list reload after `:!` and rely on change detection.
	This should result in somewhat better performance.  Thanks to opennota.

	Duplicate status bar error in dialog that reports sourcing error.  Will
	need to get rid of errors on status bar later.

	Instead of invalidating directory size previously calculated via ga/gA on
	detecting changes in the directory recalculate its size and propagate

	Limited maximum height of message popup, just print how many lines we're
	skipping.

	No vifminfo merging if file change isn't detected.  Might result in faster
	quitting in some cases.  Not accounting for some changes is still possible
	when multiple instances quit simultaneously, but same could happen without
	this change.

	Improve performance of startup and exit by omitting file existence checks.
	The cost is possibly old files staying in the state, but it should be for
	long time.  Thanks to Marcin Kurczewski (a.k.a. rr-).

	Fixed handling of doubled commas on reading/writing filetypes from/to
	vifminfo.

	Fixed displaying of extra file line in quick view when 'tuioptions'

	Consider control message when deciding width for a dialog, also don't let
	it disappear on narrow terminals.

	Provide conflict resolution options in a dialog rather than on the
	command-line, which is hard to read with so many options.

	Choose "middle" of the list of even length closer to the top (M key).
	Thanks to Svyatoslav Mishyn (a.k.a. juef).

	Update cursor position on file disappearing in more predictable way.
	Use the closes file to the previously active one that still exists.
	Thanks to ranousse.

	Make :set, :filter and :normal zo (and alike) in vifmrc affect all views,
	thus obsoleting use of :winrun or :windo for this purpose (they still
	work, the new way is a simpler and more obvious one).  This is related to
	commands executed during vifmrc processing (not those in the right-hand
	side of mappings, commands, etc.).

	Display lower bound on item count in status bar progress messages (e.g. on
	:grep).

	Do not shrink progress dialog (only make it wider), this is more

	changes.

	Thanks to Stas Malavin.

	Fixed several memory access errors and leaks.

0.7.8 to 0.8-beta (2015-06-19)

	Removed per-view last search pattern.  Don't worry, you probably won't

	loss after confirmation of overwriting files when destination matches
	source).  Thanks to Сергей Соловьёв (Sergej Soloviov).
