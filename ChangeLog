0.9.1-beta to current

	Fixed opening a directory for which the saved cursor position is not at

	and p keys copy them.

	Fixed C key not checking readability of a single unselected file, like
	:clone does.

	passed to : command.

	Added %x macro to 'rulerformat' (and thus to 'statusline') as new name for

	Added {root} key to 'viewcolumns' option (complements {ext}).  Thanks to
	Oleg Gordienko (a.k.a. gordio).

	Don't trigger DirEnter event with previous directory on startup when list
	of files is specified on stdin.  Thanks to filterfalse.

	Improved performance of mime-type detection when using libmagic (now might
	be about seven times faster by avoiding reinitialization of the library).

	Don't force file list reload after `:!` and rely on change detection.
	This should result in somewhat better performance.  Thanks to opennota.

	Duplicate status bar error in dialog that reports sourcing error.  Will
	need to get rid of errors on status bar later.

	Instead of invalidating directory size previously calculated via ga/gA on
	detecting changes in the directory recalculate its size and propagate

	Limited maximum height of message popup, just print how many lines we're
	skipping.

	quitting in some cases.  Not accounting for some changes is still possible
	when multiple instances quit simultaneously, but same could happen without
	this change.

	Behrooz.

	obtained).

	Fixed buffer overflow on obtaining file mime-type.  Thanks to Abdó
	Roig-Maranges (a.k.a. aroig).

	"cmd".  Was broken since v0.8 in an attempt to make cmd work better with
	Unicode (but its /U flag affects only input and output streams).

	Fixed completion of command-line of this format: `:!~/...`.

	Fixed epic bug in processing selectors followed by other commands in a
	mapping.  Command which accepted selector was called after tail of

	Fixed quite strange behaviour if command-line is too fill the whole
	screen (it's less strange now, resized to maximum).

0.8.1 to 0.8.1a

	Added c key to menus that inserts parts of menu line into command-line.
	Thanks to filterfalse.

	Added { and } keys to normal and visual modes.  They act similar to ( and

	use of the library.  Thanks to Badalisc and Hendrik Jaeger (a.k.a. henk).

	Fixed handling of doubled commas on reading/writing filetypes from/to
	vifminfo.

	Fixed displaying of extra file line in quick view when 'tuioptions'

	Don't trigger DirEnter on exiting custom-view (when we technically stay in
	the same directory).  Thanks to aleksejrs.

	Somewhat align options in conflict resolution dialog.  Patch by Svyatoslav
	Mishyn (a.k.a. juef).

	Copy timestamps and permissions on merging directories.  Thanks to
	willemw12.

	Less blinking on resorting.  Annoying if directory is resorted from

	is a notice in that script now about it just in case).  Thanks to Hendrik
	Jaeger (a.k.a. henk).

	Changed 'fusehome' default from temporary directory to data directory (that
	is $XDG_DATA_HOME/.local/share/fuse/ or $VIFM/fuse/ depending on which
	parent directory exists, the second one exists by definition, but first
	might not).  Thanks to aleksejrs and to Hendrik Jaeger (a.k.a. henk).

	Added :winc[md] command-line command.  Thanks to fogine.

	Added layoutis() builtin function that answers queries about current
	interface configuration.  Thanks to fogine.

	options that are specific to current directory and are reset on directory
	change, similar to local options of Vim.

	Added named bookmarks (paths are associated with tags).  This adds :bmark,
	:bmarks, :bmgo and :delbmarks command-line commands.  Also there is new
	"bmarks" value for 'vifminfo'.  Thanks to Schmalzhaf Stefan.

	Added handling of dd in :trashes, :trashes? and :lstrashes, which either
	deletes an item in trash or empties trash.  Thanks to Svyatoslav

	names of currently running vifm servers and sets name of target/this
	instance respectively.

	startup log.  Thanks to Cosmin Popescu (a.k.a. cosminadrianpopescu).

	Added handling of "%u" in trash specification on *nix, which is replaced
	with real user ID.  Thanks to Regis.

	Changed default value of 'trashdir' on *nix again, this time to
	"%r/.vifm-Trash-%u,$VIFM/Trash,%r/.vifm-Trash".  This way it's safer for
	privacy, although using %r is not very safe in general.  Thanks to Regis.

	Do not finish argument parsing after finding --help or --version,
	continue and validate the rest of command-line.  Thanks to Svyatoslav

	Michael Vetter (a.k.a. jubalh).

	Document %= for 'statusline' and 'rulerformat'.

	Proper recovery from loading of color scheme unsupported by the terminal
	at startup.  Thanks to Svyatoslav Mishyn (a.k.a. juef).

	Automatically create ~/.vifm/scripts containing small README file if the
	directory doesn't exist on startup.  Thanks to fogine.

	Consider control message when deciding width for a dialog, also don't let
	it disappear on narrow terminals.

	Provide conflict resolution options in a dialog rather than on the
	command-line, which is hard to read with so many options.

	Choose "middle" of the list of even length closer to the top (M key).
	Thanks to Svyatoslav Mishyn (a.k.a. juef).

	Update cursor position on file disappearing in more predictable way.
	Use the closes file to the previously active one that still exists.
	Thanks to ranousse.

	Make :set, :filter and :normal zo (and alike) in vifmrc affect all views,
	thus obsoleting use of :winrun or :windo for this purpose (they still
	work, the new way is a simpler and more obvious one).  This is related to
	commands executed during vifmrc processing (not those in the right-hand
	side of mappings, commands, etc.).

	Display lower bound on item count in status bar progress messages (e.g. on
	:grep).

	Do not shrink progress dialog (only make it wider), this is more
	predictable and easier to follow.  Thanks to Robert Sarkozi.

	More hints for Debian-based systems on installation.  Thanks to Bernhard
	Grotz.

	Expand "~" in menus on navigation.

	Unicode conversion issues.

	Assume UTF-8 sequences can be broken.  Thanks to Svyatoslav Mishyn (a.k.a.
	juef).

	Check file system sensitivity on OS X.  Thanks to loongw.

	Allow 'shell' to specify a shell argument on *nix.  Thanks to loongw.

	Make "p" in 'tuioptions' affect padding in quick view and view mode.

	Documented difference between paths in menu with and without trailing
	slash.  Thanks to filterfalse.

	Save location before loading custom view into view directory history.
	Thanks to filterfalse.

	Invalidate directory size (calculated via ga/gA) if noticed that directory
	was changed.  This affects all parent directories as well, way easier to
	see what needs recalculation after file moving/removal.

	Ctrl-W | and Ctrl-W _ now can set window size to given count.  Thanks to
	filterfalse.

	Make sure confirmation dialog doesn't appear for background operations.

	Rewrote expression parser to prevent side-effects from occurring until
	syntax is checked.

	Put right-hand side of user-defined commands into separate scope of
	if-else-endif expressions.  This prevents affecting of regular input by
	malformed user-defined command.

	Fixed resetting "vborder" of 'fillchars' after it has been set to
	something (as in `:set fillchars=vborder:\* fillchars&`).

	Fixed crash after color scheme load failure possible in scenarios where
	file name specific highlights are used.

	Fixed use of uninitialized value which could affect whether pattern is
	matches whole path or only its name part.

	Fixed tests failures when run with root privileges.  Thanks to Ondrej
	Novy (a.k.a. onovy).

	Fixed running backgrounded commands with non-latin characters on
	Windows (that end with " &", should be OK to just drop it on Windows
	and get correct behaviour on 0.8).  Thanks to Stas Malavin.

	Fixed running of executables with spaces in paths on Windows with cmd.
	Thanks to Stas Malavin.

	Fixed choosing user vs. default shell on Windows (was reversed), related
	to %S, %i and alike macros.

	Fixed losing view sorting on failed attempt to load custom view.  Thanks
	to filterfalse.

	Fixed not restoring 'sort' value on leaving unsorted custom view.

	option.

	Fixed unintentional filters resetting on menu navigation to paths that
	have trailing slash.

	version.  Thanks to Alexandre Viau.

	Fixed possible vifminfo shrinking (some data were removed from it) if an
	error occurs during initialization.

	Fixed highlight not being updated after file rename.

	Fixed possible hang during startup on Windows after removal of last
	visited directory.

0.8-beta to 0.8

	Added handling of Ctrl-L to sort dialog.  Thanks to filterfalse.

	Added device id (major and minor numbers) to file info dialog.

	Added script to update timestamps, so that build system won't be
	regenerated without real reason.  One might want to run it when building
	from git checkout, which doesn't preserve correct timestamps.

	Append unused space in view columns to the last one with percent sizing
	type if any.  Thanks to fogine.

	Drastically increased performance of custom view composing.

	Be more accurate when deciding whether view displays graphics,

	would hide builtin command.  Redefining commands without suffixes is not
	allowed, thus this shouldn't be allowed too.

	Better "all" pseudo-option parsing and support of resetting it.

	Do not display same path twice in detailed progress information (after
	both "file" and "from").

	Shorten paths in "file" and "from" in progress dialog.

	Sync approximate and accurate forms of progress dialogs.

	Fixed pane titles update on switching panes.

	Fixed build on OpenBSD.  Patch by Brian Callahan (a.k.a. ibara).

	Fixed possible constant view reload when built on some systems.  Thanks to
	hofheinz.

	Fixed error reporting on builtin function argument parsing in rhs of :let
	expression.  Thanks to Svyatoslav Mishyn (a.k.a. juef).

	Fixed infinite loop or crash on empty match on search in view mode (e.g.
	on /$).

	Fixed crash/leak on processing of background jobs.  Thanks to Christian
	Fillion (a.k.a. cfillion).

	Fixed several memory access errors and leaks.

0.7.8 to 0.8-beta

	Removed per-view last search pattern.  Don't worry, you probably won't

	fixes issue with passing input to FUSE mounter.  Thanks to Johannes (a.k.a.
	johannesmeng).

	Added %[ and %] macros for statusline/ruler.  Thanks to ranousse.

	Added single-argument form of :file[x]type and :fileviewer commands that

	Hendrik Jaeger (a.k.a. henk) and Michael Maddern (a.k.a. madders).

	Added F key to less-like (file view) mode, which acts similar to `tail -F`

	Thanks to filterfalse.

	Display error on encountering unknown values assigned to 'sort' option.

	Allowed use of :filter syntax in user-defined filter commands (e.g.

	commands.  Thanks to y2kbugger.

	Renamed "default color scheme" to "primary color scheme" in documentation

	Documented environment variables used by vifm separately as usually done
	in documentation for other applications.

	Made +/- operands after semicolon in command-line range adjust base range
	end position rather than base cursor position as Vim does.  Thanks to

	filterfalse.

	Repeat search with last used search pattern on empty pattern of the search
	mode.

	on composing menu).

	Optimized speed of checking existence of a directory (important on
	displaying directory history).

	Skip nonexistent directories on Ctrl-O/Ctrl-I.

	Extended 'slowfs' option format to allow path prefixes (in particular,
