.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Using Count
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.TP

.TP
Or you can use count with motions passed to y, d or D.
.TP
.BI d[count]j
delete (count + 1) files starting from current cursor position upward.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Registers
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.LP
vifm supports multiple registers for temporary storing list of yanked or
deleted files.

Registers should be specified with hitting double quite key followed by a
register name.  Count is specified after register name.  By default commands use
unnamed register, which has double quote as its name.

Though all commands accept registers, most of commands ignores them (for example
H or Ctrl-U).  Other commands can fill register or append new files to it.

Presently vifm supports ", _, a-z and A-Z characters as register names.

As mentioned above " is unnamed register and has special meaning of the default
register.  Every time when you use named registers (a-z and A-Z) unnamed
register is updated to contain same list of files as the last used register.

_ is black hole register.  It can be used for writing, but its list is always
empty.

Registers with names from a to z  and from A to Z are named ones.  Lowercase
registers are cleared before adding new files, while uppercase aren't and should
be used to append new files to the existing file list of appropriate lowercase
register (A for a, B for b, ...).

Registers can be changed on :empty command if they contain files under Trash
directory.

Registers do not contain one file more than once.

Example:
  "a2yy
.br
will put names of two files to register a (and to the unnamed register).
  "Ad
.br
will remove one file and append its name to register a (and to the unnamed
register).
  p or "ap or "Ap
.br
will insert previously yanked and deleted files into current directory.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Selectors
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.TP
y and d commands accept selectors.  You can combine them with every of
selectors below to quickly remove or yank several files.
.br
Most of selectors are like vi motions: j, k, gg, G, H, L, M, %, f, F, ;, comma
and '.  But there are some additional ones.

.SH Ranges
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ranges implemented include:
  Numbers :2,3
  % - the entire directory.
  . - the current position in the filelist.
  $ - the end of the filelist.
  't - the mark position t.

  :%delete would delete all files in the directory.
  :2,4delete would delete the files in the list positions 2 through 4.
  :.,$delete would delete the files from the current position to the end
    of the filelist.
  :3delete4 would delete the files in the list positions 3, 4, 5, 6.

If a backward range is given :4,2delete - an query message is given and
user can chose what to do next.

The builtin commands that accept a range are :d[elete] and :y[ank].
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Command macros
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The command macros may be used in user commands.
.TP
.BI %a
User arguments.

The current file under the cursor.
.TP
.BI "%C %""C"
The current file under the cursor in the other directory.
.TP
.BI "%f %""f"

.TP
.BI "%F %""F"
All of the selected files in the other directory list.
.TP
.BI "%b %""b"

Full path to current directory.
.TP
.BI "%D %""d"
Full path to other file list directory.

Same as %m, but l (or Enter) key is handled like for :locate and :find commands.
.TP
.BI %S
Show command output in the status bar.
.TP
.BI %s
Execute command in screen split.
.LP
Use %% if you need to put a percent sign in your command.

You can use filename modifiers after %c, %C, %f, %F, %b, %d and %D macros.
Supported modifiers are:
.IP - 2
:p           - full path
.IP - 2
:u           - UNC name of path (e.g. "\\\\server" in "\\\\server\\share"), Windows only.  Expands to current computer name for not UNC paths.
.IP - 2
:~           - relative to the home directory
.IP - 2
:.           - relative to current directory
.IP - 2
:h           - head of the filename
.IP - 2
:t           - tail of the filename
.IP - 2
:r           - root of the filename (without last extension)
.IP - 2
:e           - extension of the filename (last one)
.IP - 2
:s?pat?sub?  - substitute the first occurrence of pat with sub.  You can use any character for '?', but it must not occur in pat or sub.
.IP - 2
:gs?pat?sub? - like :s, but substitutes all occurrences of pat with sub.

See ':h filename-modifiers' in Vim's documentation for the detailed
description.

Using %x means expand corresponding macro escaping all characters that have
special meaning.  And %"x means using of double quotes and escape only backslash
and double quote characters, which is more useful on Windows systems.

Position and quantity (if there is any) of %m, %M, %S or %s macros in the
command is unimportant.  All their occurrences will be removed from the
resulting command.

%c and %f macros are expanded to file names only, when %C and %F are expanded
to full paths.  %f and %F follow this in %b too.
.TP
.BI ":com move mv %f %D"
would set the :move command to move all of the files
selected in the current directory to the other directory.
.TP
The %a macro will substitute any arguments given in a command into the command.  All arguments are considered optional.  ":com lsl !!ls -l %a" will set the lsl command to execute ls -l with or without an argument.
.TP
.BI ":lsl<Return>"
will list the directory contents of the current directory.
.TP
.BI ":lsl filename<Return>"
will list only the given filename.
.TP
The macros can also be used in directly executing commands. ":!mv %f %D" would move the current directory selected files to the other directory.
.TP
Appending & to the end of a command will cause it to be executed in the background.
.BI ":!mv %f %D &"
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Command backgrounding
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Copy and move operation can take a lot of time to proceed.  That's why vifm
supports backgrounding of this two operations.  To run :copy, :move or :delete
command in the background just add " &" at the end of a command.

For each background operation a new thread will be created.  Currently job
cannot be stopped or paused.

You can see if command is still running in the :jobs menu.  Backgrounded
commands have progress instead of process id at the line beginning.

Background operations cannot be undone.

vifm removes whitespace characters at the beginning and end of commands.
That's why you may want to use <space> at the end of rhs in mappings.  For
example:

.EX
 cmap <f1> man<space>
.EE

will put "man " in line when you hit the <f1> key in the command line mode.

but preserve it for directories, set all execute flags to 'd' and check \
\'Set Recursively' flag.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Startup
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
On startup vifm determines several variables that are used during the session.
They are determined in the order they appear below.

On *nix systems $HOME is normally present and used as is.
On Windows systems vifm tries to find correct home directory in the following
order:
 - $HOME variable;
 - $USERPROFILE variable;
 - a combination of $HOMEDRIVE and $HOMEPATH variables.

vifm tries to find correct configuration directory by checking the following
places:
 - $VIFM variable;
 - parent directory of the executable file (on Windows only);
 - $HOME/.vifm directory;
 - $APPDATA/Vifm directory (on Windows only).

vifm tries to find correct configuration file by checking the following places:
 - $MYVIFMRC variable;
 - vifmrc in parent directory of the executable file (on Windows only);
 - $VIFM/vifmrc file.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Configure
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
See Startup section above for the explanations on $VIFM and $MYVIFMRC.

The vifmrc file contains commands that will be executed on vifm startup.  See
$MYVIFMRC variable description for search algorithm used to find vifmrc.
Use it to set settings, mappings, filetypes etc.  To use multi line commands
precede each next line with a slash (whitespace before slash is ignored, but all
spaces at the end of the lines are saved).  For example:
set
    \\smartcase
equals "setsmartcase".  When
set<space here>
    \ smartcase
equals "set  smartcase".

The $VIFM/vifminfo file contains session settings.  You may edit it by hand
to change the settings, but it's not recommended to do that, edit vifmrc
instead.  You can control what settings will be saved in vifminfo by setting
\'vifminfo' option.  Vifm always writes this file on exit unless 'vifminfo'
option is empty.  Bookmarks, commands, directory history, filetypes, fileviewers
and registers in the file are merged with vifm configuration (which has bigger
priority).

The $VIFM/scripts directory can contain shell scripts.  vifm modifies
it's PATH environment variable to let user run those scripts without specifying
full path.  All subdirectories of the $VIFM/scripts will be added to PATH too.
Script in a subdirectory overlaps script with the same name in all its parent
directories.

The $VIFM/colors directory contains color schemes.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Plugin
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plugin for using vifm in vim as a file selector.

Commands:

  :EditVifm   select a file or files to open in the current buffer.
  :SplitVifm  split buffer and select a file or files to open.
  :VsplitVifm vertically split buffer and select a file or files to open.
  :DiffVifm   select a file or files to compare to the current file with
              :vert diffsplit.
  :TabVifm    select a file or files to open in tabs.

Each command accepts up to two arguments: left pane directory and right pane
directory.

The plugin have only two settings.  It's a string variable named g:vifm_term to
let user specify command to run gui terminal.  By default it's equal to
\'xterm -e'.  And anoter string variable named g:vifm_exec, which equals "vifm"
by default and specifies path to vifm's executable.  To pass arguments to
vifm use g:vifm_exec_args, which is empty by default.

To use the plugin copy the vifm.vim file to either the system wide vim/plugin
directory or into ~/.vim/plugin.

If you would prefer not to use the plugin and it is in the system wide plugin
directory add

let loaded_vifm=1

to your ~/.vimrc file.
