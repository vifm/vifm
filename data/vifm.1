.SH NAME
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
vifm \- vi file manager
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH SYNOPSIS
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
vifm [OPTION]...
.br
vifm [OPTION]... LWIN_DIR
.br
vifm [OPTION]... LWIN_DIR RWIN_DIR
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vifm is a ncurses based file manager with vi like keybindings. If you use vi,
vifm gives you complete keyboard control over your files without having to learn
a new set of commands.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH OPTIONS
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The vifm executable will start vifm in the current directory unless it is
given a different directory on the command line.
.TP
.BI <lwinpath>
Starts Vifm in the specified path.
.TP
.BI "<lwinpath> <rwinpath>"
Starts Vifm in the specified paths.
.LP
Specifying two directories triggers split view even when vifm was in single-view
mode on finishing previous session.  To suppress this behaviour :only command
can be put in the vifmrc file.
.LP
When only one path argument is found on command-line, the left/top pane is
automatically set as the current view.
.LP
Paths to files are also allowed in case you want vifm to start with some
archive opened.  If you want to select file, prepend its path with \-\-select.
.TP
.BI \-f
only used from the vifm.vim script.  The selected files are written
to $VIFM/vimfiles and vifm exits.
.TP
.BI "\-\-logging"
Log some errors to $VIFM/log.
Also /var/log/vifm\-startup\-log (on *nix) and startup\-log in the directory of
executable (on Windows) is used to log startup process (when configuration
directory isn't determined).
.TP
.BI "\-\-remote"
Sends the rest of command line to the active vifm server (one of already running
instances if any).  When there is no server, quits silently.  There is no limit
on how many arguments can be processed.  One can combine \-\-remote with \-c
<command> or +<command> to execute command in already running instance of vifm.
See also "Client\-Server" section below.
.TP
.BI "\-c <command> or +<command>"
Run command-line mode <command> on startup.  Commands in such arguments are
executed in the order they appear in command line.  Commands with spaces or
special symbols must be enclosed in double or single quotes or all special
symbols should be escaped (the exact syntax strongly depends on shell).
.TP
.BI "\-\-help, \-h"
Show an overview of the commandline options.
.TP
.BI "\-\-version, \-v"
Show version information and quit.
.TP
.BI \-\-no\-configs
Don't read vifmrc and vifminfo.

.LP
See Startup section below for the explanations on $VIFM.

.TP
If 'hlsearch' option is set, hitting n/N to perform search and go to the first \
matching item resets current selection in normal mode.  It is not the case if \
search was already performed on files in the directory, thus selection is not \
reset after clearing selection with escape key and hitting n/N key again.
.TP
.BI [count]f[character]

wraps around the end of the list.
.TP
.BI [count];
find the next match of f or F.
.TP
.BI [count],
find the previous match of f or F.
.LP
Note: f, F, ; and , wrap around list beginning and end when they are used
alone and they don't wrap when they are used as selectors.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH File Filters
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are three basic file filters:
.IP \- 2
dot files filter (excluding "." and ".." special directories, which appearance
is controlled by the 'dotdirs' option)
.IP \- 2
manual filter for file names
.IP \- 2
automatic filter for file names
.IP \- 2
local filter for file names (see description of the "=" normal mode command)
.LP
Performing operations on manual filter for file names automatically does the
same on automatic one.  The file name filter is separated mainly for
convenience purpose and to get more deterministic behaviour.

The basic vim folding key bindings are used for filtering files.
.TP
Each file list has its own copy of each filter.
.TP
Filtered files are not checked in / search or :commands.
.TP
Files and directories are filtered separately.  For this a slash is appended \
to a directory name before testing whether it matches the filter.  Examples:
.EX
.LP

  " filter directories which names end with '.files'
  :filter /^.*\\.files\\/$/

  " filter files which names end with '.d'
  :filter /^.*\\.d$/

  " filter files and directories which names end with '.o'
  :filter /^.*\\.o\\/?$/
.EE
.TP
.BI zo

.TP
.BI zR
Remove all filters.
.TP
.BI "=regular expression pattern[Return]"

to the current directory if they were deleted with dd or :d[elete] or if the
files were yanked from trash directory.  See "Trash directory" section below.
.TP
.BI P
moves the last yanked files.  The advantage of using P instead of d followed by
p is that P moves files only once.  This isn't important in case you're moving
files in the same file system where your home directory is, but using P to
move files on some other file system (or file systems, in case you want to move
files from fs1 to fs2 and your home is on fs3) can save your time.

iname members of each group have same first letter, for all other sorting keys
vifm uses size, uid, ...
.TP
.BI )

.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Using Count
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.TP
You can use count with commands like yy.
.TP
.BI [count]yy
yank count files starting from current cursor position downward.
.TP
Or you can use count with motions passed to y, d or D.
.TP
.BI d[count]j
delete (count + 1) files starting from current cursor position upward.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Registers
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.LP
vifm supports multiple registers for temporary storing list of yanked or
deleted files.

Registers should be specified with hitting double quite key followed by a
register name.  Count is specified after register name.  By default commands use
unnamed register, which has double quote as its name.

Though all commands accept registers, most of commands ignores them (for example
H or Ctrl-U).  Other commands can fill register or append new files to it.

Presently vifm supports ", _, a-z and A-Z characters as register names.

As mentioned above " is unnamed register and has special meaning of the default
register.  Every time when you use named registers (a-z and A-Z) unnamed
register is updated to contain same list of files as the last used register.

_ is black hole register.  It can be used for writing, but its list is always
empty.

Registers with names from a to z  and from A to Z are named ones.  Lowercase
registers are cleared before adding new files, while uppercase aren't and should
be used to append new files to the existing file list of appropriate lowercase
register (A for a, B for b, ...).

Registers can be changed on :empty command if they contain files under trash
directory (see "Trash directory" section below).

Registers do not contain one file more than once.

Example:
.EX

  "a2yy

.EE
.br
will put names of two files to register a (and to the unnamed register),
.EX

  "Ad

.EE
.br
will remove one file and append its name to register a (and to the unnamed
register),
.EX

  p or "ap or "Ap

.EE
.br
will insert previously yanked and deleted files into current directory.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Selectors
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.TP
y, d, D, !, gu and gU commands accept selectors.  You can combine them with \
any of selectors below to quickly remove or yank several files.
.LP
Most of selectors are like vi motions: j, k, gg, G, H, L, M, %, f, F, ;, \
comma, ', ^, 0 and $.  But there are some additional ones.
.TP
.BI a
all files in current view.
.TP
.BI s
selected files.
.TP
.BI S
all files except selected.
.LP
Examples:
.EX
 dj \- delete file under cursor and one below.
 d2j \- delete file under cursor and two below.
 y6gg \- yank all files from cursor position to 6th file in the list.
.EE

When you pass a count to whole command and its selector they are multiplied. So:
.EX
 2d2j \- delete file under cursor and four below.
 2dj \- delete file under cursor and two below.
 2y6gg \- yank all files from cursor position to 12th file in the list.
.EE
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Visual Mode

.TP
.BI gv
restore previous visual selection.
.TP
.BI v

.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Command line editing
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
vifm provides a facility to edit several kinds of data, that is usually edited
in command-line mode, in external editor (using command specified by
\'vicmd' or 'vixcmd' option).  This has at least two advantages
over built-in command-line mode:
 \- one can use full power of Vim to edit text;
 \- finding and reusing history entries becomes possible.

The facility is supported by four input submodes of the command-line:
 \- command;
 \- forward search;
 \- backward search;
 \- file rename (see description of cw and cW normal mode keys).

Editing command-line using external editor is activated by the c_CTRL-G
shortcut.  It's also possible to do almost the same from Normal and Visual
modes using q:, q/ and q? commands.

Temporary file created for the purpose of editing the line has the following
structure:
.IP 1. 4
First line, which is either empty or contains text already entered in
command-line.
.IP 2. 4
2nd and all other lines with history items starting with the most recent one.
Altering this lines in any way won't change history items stored by vifm.
.LP

After editing application is finished the first line of the file is taken as
the result of operation, when the application returns zero exit code.  If the
application returns an error (see :cquit command in Vim), all the edits made to
the file are ignored, but the initial value of the first line is saved in
appropriate history.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Commands
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Commands are executed with :command_name<Return>

Commented out lines should start with the double quote symbol, which may be
preceded by whitespace characters.

\'|' can be used to separate commands, so you can give multiple commands in one
line.  If you want to use '|' in an argument, precede it with '\\'.

These commands see '|' as part of their arguments even when it's escaped:

    :[range]!
    :cmap
    :cnoremap
    :command
    :filetype
    :fileviewer
    :filextype
    :map
    :mmap
    :mnoremap
    :nmap
    :nnoremap
    :noremap
    :normal
    :qmap
    :qnoremap
    :vmap
    :vnoremap
    :windo
    :winrun

To be able to use another command after one of these, wrap it with the :execute
command.  An example:
.EX
    if filetype('.') == 'reg' | execute '!!echo regular file' | endif

run associated command that begins with the arg without opening menu.
.TP
.BI ":filet[ype] pat1,pat2,... [{descr}]def_prog[ &],[{descr}]prog2[ &],..."
will associate given program list to each of the patterns.  Associated
program (command) is used by handlers of l and Enter keys (and also in
the :file menu).  If you need to insert comma into command just double it
(",,").  Space followed by an ampersand as two last characters of a command
means running of the command in the background.  Optional description can be
given to each command to ease understanding of what command will do in the
:file menu.  Vifm will try the rest of the programs for an association when
the default isn't found.  When program entry doesn't contain any of vifm
macros, name of current file is appended as if program entry ended with %c
macro.  On Windows path to executables containing spaces can (and should be
for correct work with such paths) be double quoted.  See "Globs" section
below for pattern definition.  See also "Automatic FUSE mounts" section
below.  Example for zip archives and several actions:

.EE
 filetype *.zip,*.jar,*.war,*.ear
        \\ {Mount with fuse-zip}
        \\ FUSE_MOUNT|fuse-zip %SOURCE_FILE %DESTINATION_DIR,
        \\ {View contents}

        \\ tar -xf %c,
.EX
.TP
.BI ":filex[type] pat1,pat2,... [{ description }] def_program,program2,..."
same as :filetype, but vifm will ignore this command if it's not running in X.
In X :filextype is equal to :filetype.  See "Globs" section below for pattern
definition.  See also "Automatic FUSE mounts" section below.
.TP
.BI ":filev[iewer] pat1,pat2,... command"
will associate given command as a viewer to each of the patterns.  Viewer is a
command which output is captured and showed in the second pane of vifm after
running :view command.  When the command doesn't contain any of vifm macros,
name of current file is appended as if command ended with %c macro.  See
"Globs" section below for pattern definition.  Example for zip archives:

.EE
 fileviewer *.zip,*.jar,*.war,*.ear zip -sf %c
.EX
.TP
.BI ":filter[!] regular_expression_pattern"
.BI ":filter[!] /regular_expression_pattern/"
will filter all the files out of the directory listing that match the regular
expression.  Using second variant you can use the bar ('|') symbol without
escaping.  Empty regular expression (specified by //, "" or '') means using of
the last search pattern.  Use '!' to control state of filter inversion after
updating filter value (also see 'cpoptions' description).  Filter is matched
case sensitively on *nix and case insensitively on Windows.
.br
:filter /\.o$ would filter all files ending in .o from the filelist.
.br
Note: vifm uses extended regular expressions.
.TP
.BI ":filter"
reset filter (set it to empty string) and show all files.

.BI ":filter!"
same as :invert.
.TP
.BI :filter?
show current value of name and auto filters.
.TP
.BI ":[range]fin[d] pattern"
will show results of find command in the menu.  Searches among selected files if
any.  Accepts macros.  By default the command relies on the external "find"
utility, which can be customized by altering value of the 'findprg' option.
.TP
.BI ":[range]fin[d] \-opt..."
same as :find above, but user defines all find arguments.  Searches among
selected files if any.
.TP
.BI ":[range]fin[d] path \-opt..."
same as :find above, but user defines all find arguments.  Ignores selection and
range.
.TP
.BI :[range]fin[d]
repeats last :find command.
.TP
.BI :fini[sh]
Stop sourcing a script. Can only be used in a vifm script file. This is a quick
way to skip the rest of the file.
.TP
.BI ":[range]gr[ep][!] pattern"
will show results of grep command in the menu.  Add "!" to request inversion of
search (look for lines that do not match pattern).  Searches among selected
files if any and no range given.  Ignores binary files by default.  By default
the command relies on the external "grep" utility, which can be customized by
altering value of the 'grepprg' option.
.TP
.BI ":[range]gr[ep][!] \-opt..."
same as :grep above, but user defines all find arguments, which are not escaped.
Searches among selected files if any.
.TP
.BI :[range]gr[ep][!]
repeats last :grep command.  "!" of this command inverts "!" in repeated
command.
.TP
.BI :h[elp]
show the help file.
.TP
.BI ":h[elp] argument"
is the same as using ':h argument' in vim.  Use vifm\-<something> to get help
on vifm (tab completion works).  This form of the command doesn't work when
\'vimhelp' option is off.
.TP
.BI :hi[ghlight]
will show information about all highlight groups in the current directory.
.TP
.BI ":hi[ghlight] group\-name"
will show information on given highlight group of the default color scheme.
.TP
.BI ":hi[ghlight] group\-name cterm=style | ctermfg=color | ctermbg=color"
sets style (cterm), foreground (ctermfg) or/and background (ctermbg) parameters
of highlight groups of the current default color scheme.
.LP
Available style values (some of them can be combined):
 \- bold
 \- underline
 \- reverse or inverse
 \- standout
 \- none

Available group-name values:
 \- Win \- color of all windows (views, dialogs, menus)
 \- Border \- color of vertical parts of the border
 \- TopLineSel \- top line color of the current pane
 \- TopLine \- top line color of the other pane
 \- CmdLine \- the command line/status bar color
 \- ErrorMsg \- color of error messages in the status bar
 \- StatusLine \- color of the line above the status bar
 \- WildMenu \- color of the wild menu items
 \- CurrLine \- line at cursor position in the view
 \- Selected \- color of selected files
 \- Directory \- color of directories
 \- Link \- color of symbolic links in the views
 \- BrokenLink \- color of broken symbolic links
 \- Socket \- color of sockets
 \- Device \- color of block and character devices
 \- Executable \- color of executable files
 \- Fifo \- color of fifo pipes

Available colors:
 \- \-1 or default or none \- default or transparent
 \- black
 \- red
 \- green
 \- yellow
 \- blue
 \- magenta
 \- cyan
 \- white

Light versions of colors are regular colors with bold attribute set.  So order
of arguments of :highlight command is important and it's better to put "cterm"
in front of others to prevent it from overwriting attributes set by "ctermfg" or
"ctermbg" arguments.

Since there are two colors and only one bold attribute it affects both colors
when "reverse" attribute is used when running vifm in terminal emulator.  While
linux native console can handle boldness of foreground and background colors
independently, which is for consistency with terminal emulators accessible from
vifm only implicitly by using light versions of colors.

Here is the hierarchy of highlight groups, which you need to know for using
transparency:
  StatusLine
    WildMenu
  Border
  CmdLine
    ErrorMsg
  Win
    Directory
    Link
    BrokenLink
    Socket
    Device
    Fifo
    Executable
      Selected
        CurrLine
  TopLine
    TopLineSel

"none" means default terminal color for highlight groups at the first level of
the hierarchy and transparency for all others.

environment variable, function call or a concatanation of any of them in any \
order using the '.' operator.  Any whitespace is ignored.
.TP
.BI ":locate filename"
uses the locate command to create a menu of filenames
Selecting a file from the menu will reload the current file list in vifm
to show the selected file.  By default the command relies on the external
"locate" utility (it's assumed that its database is already built), which can be
customized by altering value of the 'locateprg' option.
.TP
.BI :locate
repeats last :locate command.
.TP
.BI ":[range]ma[rk][?] x [/full/path] [filename]"
Set mark x (a\-zA\-Z0\-9) at /full/path and filename.  By default current directory

toggles whether to use the terminal multiplexer or not.
.br
A terminal multiplexer uses pseudo terminals to allow multiple windows to be
used in the console or in a single xterm.  Starting vifm from terminal
multiplexer with appropriate support turned on will cause vifm to open a new
terminal multiplexer window for each new file edited or program launched from
vifm.
.br
This requires screen version 3.9.9 or newer for the screen \-X argument or tmux
(version or newer 1.8 is recommented).

.SH Ranges
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ranges implemented include:
  2,3 \- from second to third file in the list (including it)
  % \- the entire directory.
  . \- the current position in the filelist.
  $ \- the end of the filelist.
  't \- the mark position t.

Examples:
.EX

  :%delete

.EE
would delete all files in the directory.
.EX

  :2,4delete

.EE
would delete the files in the list positions 2 through 4.
.EX

  :.,$delete

.EE
would delete the files from the current position to the end of the filelist.
.EX

  :3delete4

.EE
would delete the files in the list positions 3, 4, 5, 6.

If a backward range is given :4,2delete \- an query message is given and
user can chose what to do next.

The builtin commands that accept a range are :d[elete] and :y[ank].
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Command macros
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The command macros may be used in user commands.
.TP
.BI %a
User arguments.  When user arguments contain macros, they are expanded before
preforming substitution of %a.
.TP
.BI "%c %""c"
The current file under the cursor.
.TP
.BI "%C %""C"
The current file under the cursor in the other directory.
.TP
.BI "%f %""f"
All of the selected files.
.TP
.BI "%F %""F"
All of the selected files in the other directory list.
.TP
.BI "%b %""b"
Same as %f %F.
.TP
.BI "%d %""d"
Full path to current directory.
.TP
.BI "%D %""D"
Full path to other file list directory.
.TP
.BI "%rx %""rx"
Full paths to files in the register {x}.
In case of invalid symbol in place of {x}, it's processed with the rest of the
line and default register is used.
.TP
.BI %m
Show command output in a menu.
.TP
.BI %M
Same as %m, but l (or Enter) key is handled like for :locate and :find commands.
.TP
.BI %S
Show command output in the status bar.
.TP
.BI %s
Execute command in split window of active terminal multiplexer (ignored if not
running inside one).
.TP
.BI %i
Completely ignore command output.
.LP
Use %% if you need to put a percent sign in your command.

Note that %m, %M, %s, %S and %i macros are mutually exclusive. Only the last one
of them in the command will take effect.

You can use filename modifiers after %c, %C, %f, %F, %b, %d and %D macros.
Supported modifiers are:
.IP \- 2
:p           \- full path
.IP \- 2
:u           \- UNC name of path (e.g. "\\\\server" in "\\\\server\\share"), Windows only.  Expands to current computer name for not UNC paths.
.IP \- 2
:~           \- relative to the home directory
.IP \- 2
:.           \- relative to current directory
.IP \- 2
:h           \- head of the filename
.IP \- 2
:t           \- tail of the filename
.IP \- 2
:r           \- root of the filename (without last extension)
.IP \- 2
:e           \- extension of the filename (last one)
.IP \- 2
:s?pat?sub?  \- substitute the first occurrence of pat with sub.  You can use any character for '?', but it must not occur in pat or sub.
.IP \- 2
:gs?pat?sub? \- like :s, but substitutes all occurrences of pat with sub.

See ':h filename\-modifiers' in Vim's documentation for the detailed
description.

Using %x means expand corresponding macro escaping all characters that have
special meaning.  And %"x means using of double quotes and escape only backslash
and double quote characters, which is more useful on Windows systems.

Position and quantity (if there is any) of %m, %M, %S or %s macros in the
command is unimportant.  All their occurrences will be removed from the
resulting command.

%c and %f macros are expanded to file names only, when %C and %F are expanded
to full paths.  %f and %F follow this in %b too.
.TP
.BI ":com move mv %f %D"
would set the :move command to move all of the files
selected in the current directory to the other directory.
.TP
The %a macro will substitute any arguments given in a command into the command.  All arguments are considered optional.  ":com lsl !!ls \-l %a" will set the lsl command to execute ls \-l with or without an argument.
.TP
.BI ":lsl<Return>"
will list the directory contents of the current directory.
.TP
.BI ":lsl filename<Return>"
will list only the given filename.
.TP
The macros can also be used in directly executing commands. ":!mv %f %D" would move the current directory selected files to the other directory.
.TP
Appending & to the end of a command will cause it to be executed in the background.\
Typically you want to run two kinds of external commands in the\
background:
 \- GUI applications that doesn't fork thus block vifm (:!sxiv %f &);
 \- console tools that do not work with terminal (:!mv %f %D &).
.TP
You don't want to run terminal commands, which require terminal input or\
output something because they will mess up vifm's TUI. Anyway, if you did run\
such a command, you can use Ctrl-L key to update vifm's TUI.
.TP
Rewriting the example command with macros given above with backgrounding:
.EX

 :!mv %f %D &
.EE
.LP
Note that %m, %M, %s, %S and %i macros have bigger priority than &.  So
command containing at least one of them can't be backgrounded and " &" at the
end will be just silently ignored.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Command backgrounding
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Copy and move operation can take a lot of time to proceed.  That's why vifm
supports backgrounding of this two operations.  To run :copy, :move or :delete
command in the background just add " &" at the end of a command.

For each background operation a new thread will be created.  Currently job
cannot be stopped or paused.

You can see if command is still running in the :jobs menu.  Backgrounded
commands have progress instead of process id at the line beginning.

Background operations cannot be undone.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Globs
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
:filetype, :filextype and :fileviewer commands support globs
to match file names.  Here is a short overview of globs and some important
points that one needs to know about them.

Only names of files are matched by the globs, not full paths.  E.g.
.EX
 :filetype Makefile make %c
.EE
will match files with name "Makefile" regardless whether it's in root or home
directory.

*, ?, [ and ] are treated as special symbols in the pattern.  E.g.
.EX
 :filetype * less %c
.EE
matches all files.  One can use character classes for escaping, so
.EX
 :filetype [*] less %c
.EE
matches only one file name, the one which contains only asterisk symbol.

* means any number of any characters (possibly an empty substring), with one
exception: asterisk at the pattern beginning doesn't match dot in the first
position.  E.g.
.EX
 :fileviewer *.zip,*.jar zip \-sf %c
.EE
associates using of zip program to preview all files with zip or jar
extensions as listing of their content.

? means any character at this position.  E.g.
.EX
 :fileviewer ?.out file %c
.EE
calls file tool for all files which has exactly one character before their
extension (e.g. a.out, b.out).

Square brackets designate character class, which means that whole character
class matches against any of characters listed in it.  For example
.EX
 :fileviewer *.[ch] highlight \-O xterm256 \-s dante \-\-syntax c %c
.EE
makes vifm call highlight program to colorize source and header files in C
language for a 256-color terminal.  Equal command would be
.EX
 :fileviewer *.c,*.h highlight \-O xterm256 \-s dante \-\-syntax c %c
.EE

Inside square brackets ^ or ! can be used for symbol class negotiation and
the \- symbol to set a range. ^ and ! should appear right after the opening
square bracket.  For example
.EX
 :filetype *.[!d]/ inspect_dir
.EE
associates inspect_dir as additional handler for all directories that have one
character extension unless it's "d" letter.  And
.EX
 :filetype [0-9].jpg sxiv
.EE
associates sxiv picture viewer only for JPEG-files that contain single digit
in their name.

.SH :set options
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.TP
.BI "Local options"
These are kind of options that are local to a specific view. So you can set
ascending sorting order for left pane and descending order for right pane.
.TP
.BI aproposprg
type: string
.br
default: "apropos %a"
.br
Specifies format for an external command to be invoked by the :apropos command.
The format supports expanding of macros, specific for a particular *prg option,
and %% sequence for inserting percent sign literally.  This option should
include the %a macro to specify placement of arguments passed to the :apropos
command.  If the macro is not used, it will be implicitly added after a space to
the value of this option.
.TP
.BI autochpos
type: boolean
.br
default: true
.br
When disabled vifm will set cursor to the first line in the view after :cd and
:pushd commands instead of saved cursor position.  Disabling this will also
make vifm clear information about cursor position in the view history on :cd
and :pushd commands (and on startup if autochpos is disabled in the vifmrc).
l key in the :history . menu is treated like :cd command.  This option affects
bookmarks, file position will not preserved.
.TP
.BI "columns co"
type: int
.br
default: terminal width on startup
.br
Terminal width in characters.
.TP
.BI classify
type: string list
.br
default: ":dir:/"
.br
Specifies file name prefixes and suffixes depending on file types.  The format
is: [{prefix}]:{filetype}:[{suffix}].  Either {prefix} or {suffix} or both of
them can be omitted (which is the default for all unspecified file types),
this means empty {prefix} and/or {suffix}.  {prefix} and {suffix} should
consist exactly of one character. Elements are separated by commas.  Neither
prefixes nor suffixes are part of file names, so they don't affect commands
which operate on file names in any way. Comma (',') character should not be
used.  List of file type names can be found in the description of filetype()
function.
.TP
.BI "confirm cf"
type: boolean
.br
default: true
.br
Ask about permanent deletion of files (on D or :delete! command or on undo/redo
operation).
.TP
.BI "cpoptions cpo"
type: charset
.br
default: "fst"
.br

older versions of vifm.  Flags:
.br
f \- when included, running :filter command results in not inverted (matching
files are filtered out) and :filter! in inverted (matching files are left)
filter, when omitted, meaning of the exclamation mark changes to the opposite;
.br
s \- when included, yy, dd and DD normal mode commands act on selection, \
otherwise they operate on current file only;
.br
t \- when included, <tab> (thus <c-i>) behave as <space> and switch active \
pane, otherwise <tab> and <c-i> go forward in the view history.
.TP
.BI dotdirs
type: set
.br
default: nonrootparent
.br
Controls displaying of dot directories.  The following values are possible:
 \- rootparent    \- show "../" in root directory of file system
 \- nonrootparent \- show "../" in non-root directories of file system
.br
Note that empty directories will always contain "../" entry regardless of value
of this option.  "../" will disappear at the moment at least one file is created
inside the directory.
.TP
.BI fastrun
type: boolean
.br
default: false
.br
With this option turned on you can run partially entered commands with
unambiguous beginning using :! (e.g. :!Te instead of :!Terminal or :!Te<tab>).
.TP
.BI findprg
type: string
.br
default: "find %s %a \-print , -type d \\( ! \-readable -o ! -executable \\) \-prune"
.br
Specifies format for an external command to be invoked by the :find command.
The format supports expanding of macros, specific for a particular *prg option,
and %% sequence for inserting percent sign literally.  This option should
include the %s macro to specify placement of list of paths to search in and the
%a macro to specify placement of arguments passed to the :find command.  If some
of the macros are not used, they will be implicitly added after a space to the
value of the option in the following order: %s, %a.

%s and %a macro can slightly change their meaning depending on :find command
arguments.  When the first argument points to an existing directory, %s is
assigned all arguments and %a is left empty.  Otherwise, %s is assigned a dot
(".") meaning current directory or list of selected filenames if any.  %a is
assigned arguments when first argument starts with a dash ("\-"), otherwise an
escaped version of arguments, prepended by "\-name" (on *nix) or "\-iname" (on
Windows) predicate.
.TP

.BI grepprg
type: string
.br
default: "grep \-n \-H \-I \-r %i %a %s"
.br
Specifies format for an external command to be invoked by the :grep command.
The format supports expanding of macros, specific for a particular *prg option,
and %% sequence for inserting percent sign literally.  This option should
include the %i macro to specify placement of "\-v" string when inversion of
results is requested, the %a macro to specify placement of arguments passed to
the :grep command and the %s macro to specify placement of list of files to
search in.  If some of the macros are not used, they will be implicitly added
after a space to the value of the 'grepprg' option in the following order: %i,
%a, %s.

Example of setup to use ack (http://beyondgrep.com/) instead of grep:
.EX
    set grepprg=ack\\ \-H\\ \-r\\ %i\\ %a\\ %s

.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Startup
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
On startup vifm determines several variables that are used during the session.
They are determined in the order they appear below.

On *nix systems $HOME is normally present and used as is.
On Windows systems vifm tries to find correct home directory in the following
order:
 \- $HOME variable;
 \- $USERPROFILE variable;
 \- a combination of $HOMEDRIVE and $HOMEPATH variables.

vifm tries to find correct configuration directory by checking the following
places:
 \- $VIFM variable;
 \- parent directory of the executable file (on Windows only);
 \- $HOME/.vifm directory;
 \- $APPDATA/Vifm directory (on Windows only).

vifm tries to find correct configuration file by checking the following places:
 \- $MYVIFMRC variable;
 \- vifmrc in parent directory of the executable file (on Windows only);
 \- $VIFM/vifmrc file.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Configure
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
See Startup section above for the explanations on $VIFM and $MYVIFMRC.

The vifmrc file contains commands that will be executed on vifm startup.  See
$MYVIFMRC variable description for search algorithm used to find vifmrc.
Use it to set settings, mappings, filetypes etc.  To use multi line commands
precede each next line with a slash (whitespace before slash is ignored, but all
spaces at the end of the lines are saved).  For example:
.EX
  set
      \\smartcase
.EE
equals "setsmartcase".  When
.EX
  set<space here>
      \\ smartcase
.EE
equals "set  smartcase".

The $VIFM/vifminfo file contains session settings.  You may edit it by hand
to change the settings, but it's not recommended to do that, edit vifmrc
instead.  You can control what settings will be saved in vifminfo by setting
\'vifminfo' option.  Vifm always writes this file on exit unless 'vifminfo'
option is empty.  Bookmarks, commands, directory history, filetypes, fileviewers
and registers in the file are merged with vifm configuration (which has bigger
priority).

The $VIFM/scripts directory can contain shell scripts.  vifm modifies
it's PATH environment variable to let user run those scripts without specifying
full path.  All subdirectories of the $VIFM/scripts will be added to PATH too.
Script in a subdirectory overlaps script with the same name in all its parent
directories.

The $VIFM/colors directory contains color schemes.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Automatic FUSE mounts
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
vifm has a builtin support of automated FUSE file system mounts.  It is \
implemented using file associations mechanism.  To enable automated mounts, \
one needs to use a specially formated program line in filetype or \
filextype commands.  Currently two formats are supported:

1) FUSE_MOUNT
This format should be used in case when all information needed for mounting \
all files of a particular type is the same.  E.g. mounting of tar files \
don't require any file specific options.

Format line:
  FUSE_MOUNT|mounter %SOURCE_FILE %DESTINATION_DIR [%CLEAR]

Example filetype command:
.EX
  :filetype FUSE_MOUNT|fuse\-zip %SOURCE_FILE %DESTINATION_DIR
.EE

2) FUSE_MOUNT2
This format allows one to use specially formatted files to perform mounting \
and is useful for mounting remotes, for example remote file systems over ftp \
or ssh.

Format line:
  FUSE_MOUNT2|mounter %PARAM %DESTINATION_DIR [%CLEAR]

Example filetype command:
.EX
  :filetype FUSE_MOUNT2|sshfs %PARAM %DESTINATION_DIR
.EE

Example file content:
.EX
    root@127.0.0.1:/
.EE

All % macros are expanded by vifm at runtime and have the following meaning:
  \- %SOURCE_FILE is replaced by full path to selected file
  \- %DESTINATION_DIR is replaced by full path to mount directory, which is \
created by vifm basing on the value of 'fusehome' option.
  \- %PARAM value is filled from the first line of file (whole line), though \
in the future it can be changed to whole file content
  \- %CLEAR means that you want to clear screen before running mount command.

%CLEAR is an optional macro.  Other macros are not mandatory, but mount \
commands likely won't work without them.

The mounted FUSE file systems will be automatically unmounted in two cases:
.IP \- 2
when vifm quits (with ZZ, :q, etc. or when killed by signal)
.IP \- 2
when you explicitly leave mount point going up to its parent directory (with \
h, Enter on "../" or ":cd ..") and other pane is not in the same directory or \
its child directories.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH View look
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
vifm supports displaying of file list view in two different ways:
.IP \- 2
in a table mode, when multiple columns can be set using 'viewcolumns' option
(see Column view section below for details);
.IP \- 2
in a multicolumn list manner which looks almost like `ls \-x` command output
(see ls-like view section below for details).
.LP
The look is local for each view and can be chosen by changing value of the
\'lsview' boolean option.

Depending on view look some of keys change their meaning to allow more natural
cursor moving.  This concerns mainly h, j, k, l and other similar navigation
keys.

Also some of options can be ignored if they don't affect view displaying in
selected look.  For example value of 'viewcolumns' when 'lsview' is set.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH ls-like view
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
When this view look is enabled by setting 'lsview' option on, vifm will display
files in multiple columns.  Number of columns depends on the length of the
longest file name present in current directory of the view.  Whole file list is
automatically reflowed on directory change, terminal or view resize.

View looks close to output of `ls \-x` command, so files are listed left to
right in rows.

In this mode file manipulation commands (e.g. d) don't work line-wise like they
do in Vim, since such operations would be uncommon for file manipulating
tasks.  Thus, for example, dd will remove only current file.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Column view
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
View columns are described by a comma-separated list of column descriptions,
each of which has the following format
    [ '\-' ] [ fw ( [ '.' tw ] | '%' ) ] '{' type '}' '.'{0,3}
.br
where fw stands for full width and tw stands for text width.

So it basically consists of four parts:
 1. Optional alignment specifier
 2. Optional width specifier
 3. Mandatory column name
 4. Optional cropping specifier

Alignment specifier

It's an optional minus sign as the first symbol of the string.

Specifies type of text alignment within a column.  Two types are supported:
.IP \- 2
left align
.EX
     set viewcolumns=\-{name}
.EE
.IP \- 2
right align (default)
.EX
     set viewcolumns={name}
.EE
.LP
Width specifier

It's a number followed by a percent sign, two numbers (second one should be
less than or equal to the first one) separated with a dot or a single number.

Specifies column width and its units. There are tree size types:
.IP \- 2
absolute size \- column width is specified in characters
.EX
     set viewcolumns=\-100{name},20.15{ext}
.EE
results in two columns with lengths of 100 and 20 and a reserved space of five \
characters on the left of second column.
.IP \- 2
relative (percent) size \- column width is specified in percents of view width
.EX
     set viewcolumns=\-80%{name},15%{ext},5%{mtime}
.EE
results in three columns with lengths of 80/100, 15/100 and 5/100 of view width.
.IP \- 2
auto size (default) \- column width is automatically determined
.EX
     set viewcolumns=\-{name},{ext},{mtime}
.EE
results in three columns with length of one third of view width. There is no \
size adjustment to content, since it will slow down rendering.
.LP
Columns of different sizing types can be freely mixed in one view. Though
sometimes some of columns can be seen partly or be completely invisible if
there is not enough space to display them.
.LP
Column name

This is just a sort key surrounded with curly braces, e.g.
.EX
    {name},{ext},{mtime}
.EE
{name} and {iname} keys are the same and present both for consistency with
\'sort' option.

Empty curly braces ({}) are replaced with the default secondary column for
primary sort key. So after the next command view will be displayed almost as
if 'viewcolumns' is empty, but adding ellipsis for long file names:
.EX
    set viewcolumns=\-{name}..,6{}.
.EE
.LP
Cropping specifier

It's from one to three dots after closing curly brace in column format.

Specifies type of text truncation if it doesn't fix in the column. Currently
tree types are supported:
.IP \- 2
truncation \- text is truncated
.EX
     set viewcolumns=\-{name}.
.EE
results in truncation of names that are too long too fit in the view.
.IP \- 2
adding of ellipsis \- ellipsis on the left or right are added when needed
.EX
     set viewcolumns=\-{name}..
.EE
results in that ellipsis are added at the end of too long file names.
.IP \- 2
none (default) \- text can pass column boundaries
.EX
     set viewcolumns=\-{name}...,{ext}
.EE
results in that long file names can partially be written on the ext column.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Color schemes
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The color schemes in vifm can be applied in two different ways:
.IP \- 2
as the default (or main) color scheme
.IP \- 2
as local to a panel color scheme
.LP
Both types are set using |vifm\-:colorscheme| command, but of different forms:
.IP \- 2
:colorscheme color_scheme_name \- for the default color scheme
.IP \- 2
:colorscheme color_scheme_name directory \- for local color schemes
.LP
Look of different parts of the TUI (Text User Interface) is determined in \
this way:
.IP \- 2
Border, TopLineSel, TopLine, CmdLine, ErrorMsg, StatusLine and WildMenu are \
always determined by the default color scheme
.IP \- 2
CurrLine, Selected, Directory, Link, BrokenLink, Socket, Device, Executable, \
Fifo and Win are determined by default color scheme and a set of local \
colorschemes, which can be empty
.LP
There might be a set of local color schemes because they are structured
hierarchically according to file system structure. For example, having the
following piece of file system:
.EX

 ~
 `\-\- bin
    |
    `\-\- my

.EE
Two color schemes:
.EX

 # ~/.vifm/colors/for_bin
 highlight Win cterm=none ctermfg=white ctermbg=red
 highlight CurrLine cterm=none ctermfg=red ctermbg=black

 # ~/.vifm/colors/for_bin_my
 highlight CurrLine cterm=none ctermfg=green ctermbg=black

.EE
And these three commands in the vifmrc file:
.EX

 colorscheme Default
 colorscheme for_bin ~/bin
 colorscheme for_bin_my ~/bin/my

.EE
File list will look in the following way for each level:
.IP \- 2
~/ \- Default color scheme
.br
black background
.br
cursor with blue background
.IP \- 2
~/bin/ \- mix of Default and for_bin color schemes
.br
red background
.br
cursor with black background and red foreground
.IP \- 2
~/bin/my/ \- mix of Default, for_bin and for_bin_my color schemes
.br
red background
.br
cursor with black background and green foreground
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Trash directory
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
vifm has support of trash directory, which is used as temporary storage for
deleted files or files that were cut.  Using trash is controlled by the
\'trash' option, and exact path to the trash can be set with 'trashdir' option.
Trash directory in vifm differs from the system-wide one by default, because of
possible incompatibilities of storing deleted files among different file
managers.  But one can set 'trashdir' to "~/.local/share/Trash" to use a
"standard" trash directory.

There are two scenarios of using trash in vifm:
.IP 1. 4
As a place for storing files that were cut by "d" and may be inserted to some
other place in file system.
.IP 2. 4
As a storage of files, that are deleted but not purged yet.
.LP

The first scenario uses deletion ("d") operations to put files to trash and
put ("p") operations to restore files from trash directory.  Note that such
operations move files to and from trash directory, which can be long term
operations in case of different partitions or remote drives mounted locally.

The second scenario uses deletion ("d") operations for moving files to trash
directory and :empty command-line command to purge all previously deleted files.

Deletion and put operations depend on registers, which can point to files in
trash directory.  Normally, there are no nonexistent files in registers, but
vifm doesn't keep track of modifications under trash directory, so one
shouldn't expect value of registers to be absolutely correct if trash
directory was modified not by operation that are meant for it.  But this
won't lead to any issues with operations, since they ignore nonexistent
files.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Client\-Server
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
vifm supports remote execution of command-line mode commands as well as remote
changing of directories.  This is possible using \-\-remote command-line
argument.

To execute a command remotely combine \-\-remote argument with \-c <command> or
+<command>.  For example:
.EX
    vifm \-\-remote \-c 'cd /'
    vifm \-\-remote '+cd /'
.EE

To change directory not using command-line mode commands one can specify paths
right after \-\-remote argument, like this:
.EX
    vifm \-\-remote /
    vifm \-\-remote ~
    vifm \-\-remote /usr/bin /tmp
.EE

At the moment there is no way of specifying, which instance of vifm should
arguments be sent.  The main purpose of \-\-remote argument is to provide
support of using vifm as a single-instance application.

  :VsplitVifm vertically split buffer and select a file or files to open.
  :DiffVifm   select a file or files to compare to the current file with
              :vert diffsplit.
  :TabVifm    select a file or files to open in tabs.

Each command accepts up to two arguments: left pane directory and right pane
directory.  After arguments are checked, vifm process is spawned in a special
"file-picker" mode.  To pick files just open them either by pressing l, i or
Enter keys, or by running :edit command.  If no files are selected, file
under the cursor is opened, otherwise whole selection is passed to the plugin
and opened in vim.

The plugin have only two settings.  It's a string variable named g:vifm_term to
let user specify command to run gui terminal.  By default it's equal to
\'xterm \-e'.  And another string variable named g:vifm_exec, which equals "vifm"
by default and specifies path to vifm's executable.  To pass arguments to
vifm use g:vifm_exec_args, which is empty by default.

To use the plugin copy the vifm.vim file to either the system wide vim/plugin
directory or into ~/.vim/plugin.

If you would prefer not to use the plugin and it is in the system wide plugin
directory add

let loaded_vifm=1

to your ~/.vimrc file.
