vifm(1)                              Vifm                              vifm(1)



NAME
       vifm [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       Vifm  is  a ncurses based file manager with vi like keybindings. If you
       use vi, vifm gives you complete keyboard control over your files  with‐
       out having to learn a new set of commands.

OPTIONS
       The  vifm executable will start vifm in the current directory unless it
       is given a different directory on the command line.

       <lwinpath>
              Starts Vifm in the specified path.

       <lwinpath> <rwinpath>
              Starts Vifm in the specified paths.

       Paths to files are also allowed in case you want  vifm  to  start  with
       some archive opened.  If you want to select file, prepend its path with
       --select.

       -f     only used from the vifm.vim  script.   The  selected  files  are
              written to $VIFM/vimfiles and vifm exits.

       --logging
              Log  some  errors  to $VIFM/log.  Also /var/log/vifm-startup-log
              (on *nix) and startup-log in the  directory  of  executable  (on
              Windows)  is  used  to  log  startup process (when configuration
              directory isn't determined).

       --remote
              Passes all arguments that left in command line  to  active  vifm
              server (already running instance if any).

       -c <command> or +<command>
              Run <command> on startup.

       --help, -h
              Show an overview of the commandline options.

       --version, -v
              Show version information and quit.

       --no-configs
              Don't read vifmrc and vifminfo.


       See Startup section below for the explanations on $VIFM.

Marks
       Marks are set the same way as they are in vi.
              You can use this characters for marks [a-z][A-Z][0-9].

       m[a-z][A-Z][0-9]
              to set a mark for the current file.

       '[a-z][A-Z][0-9]
              moves to the file set for the mark.

Searching
       /regular expression pattern[Return]
              will highlight all files matching the pattern and go to the next
              match.

       ?regular expression pattern[Return]
              will highlight all files matching the pattern and go to the pre‐
              vious match.

       [count]n
              find the next match of / or ?.

       [count]N
              find the previous match of / or ?.

       [count]f[character]
              search forward for file with [character] as first  character  in
              name.  Search wraps around the end of the list.

       [count]F[character]
              search  backward for file with [character] as first character in
              name.  Search wraps around the end of the list.

       [count];
              find the next match of f or F.

       [count],
              find the previous match of f or F.

       Note: f, F, ; and , wrap around list beginning and end  when  they  are
       used alone and they don't wrap when they are used as selectors.

File Filters
       The basic vim folding key bindings are used for filtering files.

       All directorys will show the ../ file no matter what the filter setting
       is with the exception of the / directory.

       Each file list has its own filter.

       Filtered files are not checked in / search or :commands.

       zo     Show all of the dot files.

       zf     Filter all of the selected files.

       za     Toggle the showing and hiding of dot files.

       zm     Filter all of the dot files.

       zO     Show the filtered files.

       [count]!! and [count]!<selector>
              enter command line mode with entered ! command.  Count will mod‐
              ify range.

       Ctrl-O go backward through history.

       Ctrl-I go forward through history.

              file.

       Shift-Tab
              enters view mode (works only after  activating  view  pane  with
              :view command).

       ga     calculate directory size.

       gA     like ga, but force update.

       gf     find  link  destination (like l with 'followlinks' off, but also
              finds directories).

       gl     only for MS-Windows
              same as l key, but tries  to  run  program  with  administrative
              privileges.

       gv     go to visual mode restoring last selection.

       gs     restore last t selection, like gv for visual mode selection.

       gu<selector>
              make names of selected files lowercase.

       guu    gugu make name of current file lowercase.

       gU<selector>
              make names of selected files uppercase.

       gUU    gUgU make name of current file uppercase.

       e      explore file in the current pane.

       i      opens file with associated program even if it's an executable.

       cw     rename a file or files.

       cW     change only name of file (without extension).

       cl     change link target.

       co     only for *nix
              change file owner.

       cg     only for *nix
              change file group.

       cp     change  file  attributes  (permission  on *nix and properties on
              Windows).

       [count]C
              clone file [count] times.

       [count]dd or d[count]selector
              moves the selected files  to  the  trash  directory  (if  option
              'trash' is set otherwise delete)

       [count]DD or D[count]selector
              removes the selected files.

       Y, [count]yy or y[count]selector
              yanks the selected files.

       Y      same as yy.

       p      will  copy the yanked files to the current directory or move the
              files to the current directory if they were deleted with  dd  or
              :d[elete] or if the files were yanked from the Trash directory.

       P      moves  the  last yanked files.  The advantage of using P instead
              of d followed by p is that P moves files only once.  This  isn't
              important  in  case  you're moving files in the same file system
              where your home directory is, but using P to move files on  some
              other  file  system  (or  file systems, in case you want to move
              files from fs1 to fs2 and your home is on  fs3)  can  save  your
              time.

       al     puts symbolic links with absolute paths.

       rl     puts symbolic links with relative paths.

       t      tag the current file.

       u      undo last change.

       Ctrl-R redo last change.

       v      enter visual mode.

       V      enter visual mode.

       [count]Ctrl-A
              increment first number in file name by count (1 by default).

       [count]Ctrl-X
              decrement first number in file name by count (1 by default).

       ZQ     same as :quit!

       ZZ     same as :quit

       .      repeat last command line command (not normal mode command).

       (      goto previous group.  Groups are defined by primary sorting key.
              For name and iname members of each group have same first letter,
              for all other sorting keys vifm uses size, uid, ...

       )      goto next group.  See ( key description above.

Using Count
       You can use count with commands like yy.

       [count]yy
              yank count files starting from current cursor position downward.

       Or you can use count with motions passed to y, d or D.

       d[count]j
              delete  (count  + 1) files starting from current cursor position
              upward.

Registers
       vifm supports multiple registers for temporary storing list  of  yanked
       or deleted files.

       Registers should be specified with hitting double quite key followed by
       a register name.  Count is specified after register name.   By  default
       commands use unnamed register, which has double quote as its name.

       Though  all  commands  accept  registers, most of commands ignores them
       (for example H or Ctrl-U).  Other commands can fill register or  append
       new files to it.

       Presently vifm supports ", _, a-z and A-Z characters as register names.

       As mentioned above " is unnamed register and has special meaning of the
       default register.  Every time when you use named registers (a-z and  A-
       Z)  unnamed  register  is  updated to contain same list of files as the
       last used register.

       _ is black hole register.  It can be used for writing, but its list  is
       always empty.

       Registers with names from a to z  and from A to Z are named ones.  Low‐
       ercase registers are cleared before adding new files,  while  uppercase
       aren't and should be used to append new files to the existing file list
       of appropriate lowercase register (A for a, B for b, ...).

       Registers can be changed on :empty command if they contain files  under
       Trash directory.

       Registers do not contain one file more than once.

       Example:
         "a2yy
       will  put  names  of two files to register a (and to the unnamed regis‐
       ter).
         "Ad
       will remove one file and append its name to  register  a  (and  to  the
       unnamed register).
         p or "ap or "Ap
       will insert previously yanked and deleted files into current directory.

Selectors
       y and d commands accept selectors.  You can combine them with every of
              selectors below to quickly remove or yank several files.
              Most  of selectors are like vi motions: j, k, gg, G, H, L, M, %,
              f, F, ;, comma and '.  But there are some additional ones.

       a      all files in current view.

       s      selected files.

       S      all files except selected.

Visual Mode
       In visual mode work almost all normal mode keys, but they do not accept
       selectors.

       Enter  save selection and go back to normal mode.

       gv     restore previous visual selection.

       v      leave visual mode.

       V      leave visual mode.

       :      enter  command  line  mode.  When you leave it selection will be
              cleared.

       o      switch active selection bound.

       O      switch active selection bound.

       gu, u  make names of selected files lowercase.

       gU, U  make names of selected files uppercase.

View Mode
       This mode tries to imitate the less program.  Currently  the  following
       keys are supported:

       Shift-Tab, Tab, q, Q, ZZ
              go back to normal mode.

              rent command-line.

Commands
       Commands are executed with :command_name<Return>

       ´|' can be used to separate commands, so you can give multiple commands
       in one line.  If you want to use '|' in an argument,  precede  it  with
       '\'.

       Commented  out  lines  should start with the double quote symbol, which
       may be preceded by whitespace characters.

       :[count]

       :number
              move to the file number.
              :12 would move to the 12th file in the list.
              :0 move to the top of the list.
              :$ move to the bottom of the list.

       :[count]command
              The  only  builtin  :[count]command  are  :[count]d[elete]   and
              :[count]y[ank].

       :d3    would  delete  three files starting at the current file position
              moving down.

              Unlike vim user commands do not have to  start  with  a  capital
              letter.   User commands are run in a shell by default.  To run a
              command in the background you must set it as a  background  com‐
              mand with & at the end of the commands action (:com rm rm %f &).

       :di[splay] list ...
              display the contents of the numbered and  named  registers  that
              are  mentioned in list (for example "az to display "", "a and "z
              content).

       :dirs  display directory stack.

       :[range]e[dit] [file...]
              will load the selected or passed file or files into vi.  Accepts
              macros.

       :empty will permanently remove 'rm -fr' files from the Trash directory.
              It will also remove all operations from undolist  that  have  no
              sense  after  :empty  and  remove all records about files in the
              Trash directory from all registers.

       :exe[cute][arg...]
              will join all passed  arguments  by  inserting  a  single  space

              menu.

       :filet[ype] pat1,pat2,... def_program,program2,...
              will  associate  given  program  list  to  each of the patterns.
              Accosiated program (command) is used by handlers of l and  Enter
              keys (and also in the :file menu).  *, ?, [ and ] are treated as
              special symbols in the pattern.  Inside square brackets ^  or  !
              can be used for symbol class negotiation and the - symbol to set
              a range.  Asterisk at the pattern beginning don't accept dot  as
              the  first  character.  If you need to insert comma into command
              just double it (",,").

       :filex[type] pat1,pat2,... def_program,program2,...
              same as :filetype, but vifm will ignore this command if it's not

              will  associate  given  command  as a viewer to each of the pat‐
              terns.  Viewer is a command which output is captured and  showed
              in  the  second  pane of vifm after running :view command.  Cur‐
              rently only * and ? are treated as special symbols in  the  pat‐
              tern.

       :filter regular_expression_pattern
              :filter  /regular_expression_pattern/  will filter all the files
              out of the directory listing that match the regular  expression.
              Using second variant you can use | symbol without escaping.  Add
              :filter  /.o$  would  filter  all  files  ending  in .o from the
              filelist.
              Note: vifm uses extended regular expressions.

       :filter
              would filter no files from the filelist.

       :filter!
              same as :invert.

       :[range]fin[d] path -opt...
              same as :find  above,  but  user  defines  all  find  arguments.
              Ignores selection and range.

       :[range]fin[d]
              repeats last :find command.

       :[range]gr[ep][!] pattern
              will  show  results  of  grep  command  in the menu.  Add "!" to
              search lines that do not match pattern.  Searches among selected
              files if any and no range given.  Ignores binary files.

       :[range]gr[ep][!] -opt...
              same  as :grep above, but user defines all find arguments, which
              are not escaped.  Searches among selected files if any.

       :[range]gr[ep][!]
              repeats last :grep command.  "!" of this command inverts "!"  in
              repeated command.

       :h[elp]
              show the help file.

       :h[elp] argument

              ment list.  "!" forces overwrite.

       :screen
              toggles whether or not to use the screen program.
              The default configuration has the screen option turned off.  The
              screen program uses pseudo terminals to allow  multiple  windows
              to  be  used in the console or in a single xterm.  Starting vifm
              from screen with the screen option turned on will cause vifm  to
              open  a  new  screen  window for each new file edited or program
              launched from vifm.
              This requires screen version 3.9.9 or newer for  the  screen  -X
              argument.

       :screen?
              shows whether screen program is used.

       :se[t] shows all options that differ from their default value.

       :se[t] all
              shows all options.

       :se[t] opt1=val1 opt2='val2' opt3="val3" ...
              will set options to given values.
              You can use following syntax:
               - for all options - option, option? and option&
               - for boolean options - nooption, invoption and option!
               - for integer options - option=x, option+=x and option-=x
               - for string options - option=x
               - for string list options - option=x, option+=x and option-=x
               - for enumeration options - option=x, option+=x and option-=x
               - for enumeration options - option=x
               - for set options - option=x, option+=x and option-=x the mean‐
              ing:
               - option - turn option on (for boolean) or print its value (for
              all others)
               - nooption - turn option off
               - invoption - invert option state
               - option! - invert option state
               - option? - print option value
               - option& - reset option to its default value
               - option=x or option:x - set option to x
               - option+=x - add x to option
               -  option-=x - remove (or subtract) x from option :sh[ell] will
              start a shell.

       :sor[t]
              creates a popup menu of different sorting methods.

       :so[urce] file
              reads command-line commands from the file.

       :sp[lit]
              splits the window to show both file directories.

       :sp[lit]!
              toggles windows splitting.

       :sp[lit] path
              splits the window to show both file  directories.   And  changes
              other pane to path.

       :[range]s[ubstitite]/pattern/string/[flags]
              for each file in range replace a match of pattern with string.

       String  can contain  ...9 to link to capture groups (0 - all match, 1 -
       first group, etc.).

       Available flags:

       - i - ignore case (the 'ignorecase' and  'smartcase'  options  are  not
         used)

       - I  -  don't ignore case (the 'ignorecase' and 'smartcase' options are
         not used)

       - g - substitute all matches in each file name (each g toggles this)

       :[range]s[ubstitute]//string/[flags]
         will use previous pattern.

       :[range]s[ubstitute]
         will repeat previous substitution command.

       :sync [relative path]
         change the other panel to the current panel directory or to some path
         relative to the current directory.  Using macros is allowed.

       :touch file...
         will  create files.  Aborts on errors and won't update time of exist‐
         ing files.

       :[range]tr/pattern/string/
         for each file in range transliterate the characters which  appear  in
         pattern  to  the  corresponding  character in string.  When string is
         shorter than pattern, it's padded with its last character.

       String can contain  ...9 to link to capture groups (0 - all match, 1  -
       first group, etc.).

       :undol[ist]
              show list of latest changes.  Add ! to see commands.

       :unl[et][!] $ENV_VAR1 $ENV_VAR2 ...

              toggle on and off the quick file view.

       :vie[w]!
              turns on quick file view if it's off.

       :volumes
              only for MS-Windows
              will popup menu with volume list.  Hitting l (or Enter) key will
              open appropriate volume in the current pane.

       :w[rite]
              write  vifminfo  file  (add  !  to  force write even if settings
              weren't changed).

       :wq[!] same as :quit, but ! only disables check  of  backgrounded  com‐
              mands.

       :x[it][!]
              will exit Vifm (add ! if you don't want to save changes).

Ranges
       The ranges implemented include:
         Numbers :2,3
         % - the entire directory.
         . - the current position in the filelist.
         $ - the end of the filelist.
         't - the mark position t.

         :%delete would delete all files in the directory.
         :2,4delete would delete the files in the list positions 2 through 4.
         :.,$delete  would  delete  the files from the current position to the
       end
           of the filelist.
         :3delete4 would delete the files in the list positions 3, 4, 5, 6.

       If a backward range is given :4,2delete - an query message is given and
       user can chose what to do next.

       The builtin commands that accept a range are :d[elete] and :y[ank].

Command macros
       The command macros may be used in user commands.

       %a     User arguments.

       %c %"c The current file under the cursor.

       %C %"C The current file under the cursor in the other directory.

       %f %"f All of the selected files.

       %F %"F All of the selected files in the other directory list.

       %b %"b Same as %f %F.

       %d %"d Full path to current directory.

       %D %"d Full path to other file list directory.

       %m     Show command output in a menu.

       %M     Same as %m, but l (or Enter) key is handled like for :locate and
              :find commands.

       %S     Show command output in the status bar.

       %s     Execute command in screen split.

       Use %% if you need to put a percent sign in your command.

       You can use filename modifiers after %c, %C, %f,  %F,  %b,  %d  and  %D
       macros.  Supported modifiers are:

       - :p           - full path

       - :u              -    UNC   name   of   path   (e.g.   "\\server"   in
         "\\server\share"), Windows only.  Expands to  current  computer  name
         for not UNC paths.

       - :~           - relative to the home directory

       - :.           - relative to current directory

       - :h           - head of the filename

       - :t           - tail of the filename

       - :r           - root of the filename (without last extension)

       - :e           - extension of the filename (last one)

       - :s?pat?sub?   - substitute the first occurrence of pat with sub.  You
         can use any character for '?', but it must not occur in pat or sub.

       - :gs?pat?sub? - like :s, but substitutes all occurrences of  pat  with
         sub.

         See  ':h  filename-modifiers' in Vim's documentation for the detailed
         description.

         Using %x means expand corresponding  macro  escaping  all  characters
         that  have special meaning.  And %"x means using of double quotes and
         escape only backslash and double quote characters, which is more use‐
         ful on Windows systems.

         Position and quantity (if there is any) of %m, %M, %S or %s macros in
         the command is unimportant.  All their occurrences  will  be  removed
         from the resulting command.

         %c  and %f macros are expanded to file names only, when %C and %F are
         expanded to full paths.  %f and %F follow this in %b too.

       :com move mv %f %D
         would set the :move command to move all of the files selected in  the
         current directory to the other directory.

       The  %a macro will substitute any arguments given in a command into the
       command.  All arguments are considered optional.  ":com lsl !!ls -l %a"
       will set the lsl command to execute ls -l with or without an argument.

       :lsl<Return>
         will list the directory contents of the current directory.

       :lsl filename<Return>
         will list only the given filename.

       The  macros  can  also be used in directly executing commands. ":!mv %f
       %D" would move the current directory selected files to the other direc‐
       tory.

       Appending & to the end of a command will cause it to be executed in the
       background.
         :!mv %f %D &

Command backgrounding
       Copy and move operation can take a lot of time to proceed.  That's  why
       vifm  supports  backgrounding  of  this  two operations.  To run :copy,
       :move or :delete command in the background just add " &" at the end  of
       a command.

       For  each background operation a new thread will be created.  Currently
       job cannot be stopped or paused.

       You can see if command is still  running  in  the  :jobs  menu.   Back‐
       grounded  commands  have  progress  instead  of  process id at the line
       beginning.

       Background operations cannot be undone.

:set options
       autochpos
              type: boolean
              default: true
              When disabled vifm will set cursor to the first line in the view
              after  :cd and :pushd commands instead of saved cursor position.
              Disabling this will also make vifm clear information about  cur‐
              sor position in the view history on :cd and :pushd commands (and
              on startup if autochpos is disabled in the vifmrc).   l  key  in
              the  :history  .  menu is treated like :cd command.  This option
              affects bookmarks, file position will not preserved.

              or on undo/redo operation).

       cpoptions cpo
              type: string
              default: "s"
              Contains  a  sequence  of  single-character  flags.   Each  flag
              enables behaviour of older versions of vifm.  Flags:  s  -  when
              included, yy and dd act on the selection, otherwise they operate
              on
                  current file only.

       fastrun
              type: boolean

              With this option turned on you can run  partially  entered  com‐
              mands  with unambiguous beginning using :! (e.g. :!Te instead of
              :!Terminal or :!Te<tab>).

       followlinks

              change  this  option,  vifm  won't remount anything.  It affects
              future mounts only.

       gdefault gd
              type: boolean
              default: false
              When on, 'g' flag is on for :substitute by default.

       history hi
              type: integer
              default: 15
              Maximum number of directories in the view history and  lines  in

       ignorecase ic
              type: boolean
              default: false
              Ignore  case  in  search patterns (:substiute, / and ? commands)
              and characters after f and F commands.  It doesn't  affect  file
              filtering.

       incsearch is
              type: boolean
              default: false
              When  this option is set, search will be performed starting from
              initial cursor position each time search pattern is changed.

       laststatus ls
              type: boolean
              default: true
              Controls if status bar is visible.

              Terminal height in lines.

       rulerformat ruf
              type: string
              default: "%=%l-%S "
              Determines the content of the ruler.  Its width is 13 characters

              %= - separation point between left and right align items
              %% - percent sign
              Percent  sign  can  be followed by optional minimum field width.
              Add '-' before minimum field width if you want field to be right
              aligned.

       runexec
              type: boolean
              default: false
              Run executable file on Enter or l.

       scrollbind scb
              type: boolean
              default: false
              When  this  option  is  set, vifm will try to keep difference of
              scrolling positions of two windows constant.

       scrolloff so
              type: int
              default: 0
              Minimal number of screen lines to keep above and below the  cur‐
              sor.   If you want cursor line to always be in the middle of the
              view (except at the beginning or end of the file list), set this
              option to some large value (e.g. 999).

              A  list of mounter fs name beginnings (first column in /etc/mtab
              or /proc/mounts) that work too slow for you.  This option can be
              used  to stop vifm from making some requests to particular kinds
              of file systems that can slow  down  file  browsing.   Currently
              this means don't check if directory has changed and do not check
              if target of symbolic links exists.

       smartcase scs
              type: boolean

Mappings
       Since it's not easy to enter special characters there are several  spe‐
       cial sequences that can be used in place of them.  They are:

       <cr>   Enter key

       <bs>   Backspace key

       <tab> <s-tab>
              Tabulation and Shift+Tabulation keys

       <esc>  <space>  <home> <end> <left> <right> <up> <down> <pageup> <page‐
       down>
              Keys with obvious names.

       <del> <delete>
              Delete key.   <del>  and  <delete>  mean  different  codes,  but
              <delete> is more common.

       <c-a>,<c-b>,...,<c-z>,<c-[>,<c->,<c-]>,<c-^>,<c-_>
              Control + some key.

       <a-a>,<a-b>,...,<a-z>
              <m-a>,<m-b>,...,<m-z> Alt + some key.

       <a-c-a>,<a-c-b>,...,<a-c-z>
              <m-c-a>,<m-c-b>,...,<m-c-z> only for *nix
              Alt + Ctrl + some key.

       <f0> - <f63>
              Functional keys

       <c-f1> - <c-f12>
              only for MS-Windows
              Functional keys with Control key pressed.

       <a-f1> - <a-f12>
              only for MS-Windows
              Functional keys with Alt key pressed.

       <s-f1> - <s-f12>
              only for MS-Windows
              Functional keys with Shift key pressed.

       vifm  removes  whitespace  characters  at the beginning and end of com‐
       mands.  That's why you may want to use <space> at the  end  of  rhs  in
       mappings.  For example:

        cmap <f1> man<space>

       will  put  "man " in line when you hit the <f1> key in the command line
       mode.

Compatibility mode
       Compatibility mode:
           - <tab> to switch between panes.

       Vim like mode:
           - <c-i> (<tab>) to go forward on history.

Menus and dialogs
       General

       j, k - move.  <Escape>, Ctrl-C, ZZ, ZQ - quit.  <Return>,  l  -  select
       and exit the menu.  Ctrl-L - redraw the menu.

       In all menus

       Ctrl-B/Ctrl-F  Ctrl-D/Ctrl-U  Ctrl-E/Ctrl-Y / and ?, n/N [num]G/[num]gg
       H/M/L zb/zt/zz zh - scroll menu items [count] characters to the  right.
       zl  -  scroll  menu  items [count] characters to the left.  zH - scroll
       menu items half of screen width characters to the right.  zL  -  scroll
       menu items half of screen width characters to the left.

       All  these  keys  have the same meaning as in normal mode (but not L in
       filetype menu).

       : - enter command line mode for menus (currently only :exi[t], :q[uit],
       :x[it] and :range are supported).

       Apropos menu

       l  key  wont close the menu allowing user to pick another man page, use
       :q to close the menu.

       Commands menu

       dd on a command to remove.

       Bookmarks menu

       Escape or Ctrl-C to abort j and k to move through.  dd on a bookmark to
       remove.

       Directory stack menu

       Pressing  l  or  Enter  on  directory  name  will rotate stack to place
       selected directory pair at the top of the stack.

       Filetype menu

       Commands from vifmrc are displayed above empty line. When all  commands
       below empty line were found in .desktop files.

       J  and K - to move menu items L - save all commands above empty line as
       program list

       Fileinfo dialog

       Enter - close dialog q - close dialog

       Sort dialog

       h - switch ascending/descending.  Space - switch  ascending/descending.
       q - close dialog

       h - check/uncheck.  Space - check/uncheck.  q - close dialog

       Item states:

       - * - checked flag.

       - X - means that it has different value for files in selection.

       - d  (*nix only) - (only for execute flags) means u-x+X, g-x+X or o-x+X
         argument for the chmod program.  If you want to remove execute  right
         from  all  files,  but  preserve  it for directories, set all execute
         flags to 'd' and check ´Set Recursively' flag.

Startup
       On startup vifm determines several variables that are used  during  the
       session.  They are determined in the order they appear below.

       On  *nix  systems $HOME is normally present and used as is.  On Windows
       systems vifm tries to find correct  home  directory  in  the  following
       order:
        - $HOME variable;
        - $USERPROFILE variable;
        - a combination of $HOMEDRIVE and $HOMEPATH variables.

       vifm tries to find correct configuration directory by checking the fol‐
       lowing places:
        - $VIFM variable;
        - parent directory of the executable file (on Windows only);
        - $HOME/.vifm directory;
        - $APPDATA/Vifm directory (on Windows only).

       vifm tries to find correct configuration file by checking the following
       places:
        - $MYVIFMRC variable;
        - vifmrc in parent directory of the executable file (on Windows only);
        - $VIFM/vifmrc file.

Configure
       See Startup section above for the explanations on $VIFM and $MYVIFMRC.

       The  vifmrc  file  contains  commands  that  will  be  executed on vifm
       startup.  See $MYVIFMRC variable description for search algorithm  used
       to  find  vifmrc.  Use it to set settings, mappings, filetypes etc.  To
       use multi line commands precede each next line with a slash (whitespace
       before  slash  is  ignored,  but all spaces at the end of the lines are
       saved).  For example: set
           \smartcase equals "setsmartcase".  When set<space here>
            smartcase equals "set  smartcase".

       The $VIFM/vifminfo file contains session settings.  You may edit it  by
       hand  to change the settings, but it's not recommended to do that, edit
       vifmrc instead.  You  can  control  what  settings  will  be  saved  in
       vifminfo by setting ´vifminfo' option.  Vifm always writes this file on
       exit unless 'vifminfo' option is empty.  Bookmarks, commands, directory
       history,  filetypes,  fileviewers  and registers in the file are merged
       with vifm configuration (which has bigger priority).

       The $VIFM/scripts directory can contain shell scripts.   vifm  modifies
       it's  PATH  environment  variable to let user run those scripts without
       specifying full path.  All subdirectories of the $VIFM/scripts will  be
       added  to  PATH too.  Script in a subdirectory overlaps script with the
       same name in all its parent directories.

       The $VIFM/colors directory contains color schemes.

Plugin
       Plugin for using vifm in vim as a file selector.

       Commands:

         :EditVifm   select a file or files to open in the current buffer.
         :SplitVifm  split buffer and select a file or files to open.
         :VsplitVifm vertically split buffer and select a  file  or  files  to
       open.
         :DiffVifm    select  a  file  or files to compare to the current file
       with
                     :vert diffsplit.
         :TabVifm    select a file or files to open in tabs.

       Each command accepts up to two arguments: left pane directory and right
       pane directory.

       The  plugin  have  only  two  settings.   It's  a string variable named
       g:vifm_term to let user  specify  command  to  run  gui  terminal.   By
       default  it's  equal  to  ´xterm -e'.  And anoter string variable named
       g:vifm_exec, which equals "vifm"  by  default  and  specifies  path  to
       vifm's  executable.   To  pass  arguments to vifm use g:vifm_exec_args,
       which is empty by default.

       To use the plugin copy the vifm.vim file  to  either  the  system  wide
       vim/plugin directory or into ~/.vim/plugin.

       If  you would prefer not to use the plugin and it is in the system wide
       plugin directory add

       let loaded_vifm=1

       to your ~/.vimrc file.

Reserved
       The following command names are reserved and shouldn't be used for user
       commands.

         g[lobal]
         v[global]
