Using the vifm.vim plugin~

vifm-plugin for using vifm in Vim as a file selector.

Commands:

                                               *vifm-:EditVifm*
  :EditVifm   select a file or files to open in the current buffer.
                                               *vifm-:SplitVifm*
  :SplitVifm  split buffer and select a file or files to open.
                                               *vifm-:VsplitVifm*
  :VsplitVifm vertically split buffer and select a file or files to open.
                                               *vifm-:DiffVifm*
  :DiffVifm   select a file or files to compare to the current file with
              :vert diffsplit.
                                               *vifm-:TabVifm*
  :TabVifm    select a file or files to open in tabs.

Each command accepts up to two arguments: left pane directory and right pane
directory.  After arguments are checked, vifm process is spawned in a special
"file-picker" mode.  To pick files just open them either by pressing l, i or
Enter keys, or by running :edit command.  If no files are selected, file
under the cursor is opened, otherwise whole selection is passed to the plugin
and opened in Vim.

Once vifm is opened additional commands that correspond to commands listed
above become available:
  :EditVim
  :VsplitVim
  :SplitVim
  :DiffVim
  :TabVim
Their meaning is the same as the meaning of *Vifm, but these commands overrule
their *Vifm command used to start vifm.  *Vifm basically provide default,
which can be overwritten right on file open.

                                               *g:vifm_term*
                                               *g:vifm_exec_args*
The plugin has only two settings.  It's a string variable named g:vifm_term to
let user specify command to run GUI terminal.  By default it's equal to
'xterm -e'.  And another string variable named g:vifm_exec, which equals "vifm"
by default and specifies path to vifm's executable.  To pass arguments to
vifm use g:vifm_exec_args, which is empty by default.

To use the plugin copy the vifm.vim file to either the system wide vim/plugin
directory or into ~/.vim/plugin.

If you would prefer not to use the plugin and it is in the system wide plugin
directory add >

 let loaded_vifm=1

to your ~/.vimrc file.

Extension for "vifm" filetype~

                                                *vifm-K*
K                       Like setting 'keywordprg' to ":help vifm-" (if that
                        would be possible), but slightly smarter.  Only mapped
                        in vifm files.

Extension for "mail" filetype~

Vifm's bundle for Vim also includes a tiny mail file type extension that allows
one to pick files for attachments via Vifm.

                                               *vifm-<localleader>a*
The function is mapped to <localleader>a key for "mail" filetype buffers only.
It inserts files picked via Vifm as attachments ("Attach: ...") after
"Subject" header.
