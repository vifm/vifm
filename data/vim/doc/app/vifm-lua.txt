--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-lua-status*

Pre-pre-alpha.  Just figuring out the basics, trying things out and shaping
the design.  API is nowhere near being complete and there are some weird
ideas which can significantly affect their structure.

There is no manual page that corresponds to this document.  Rather significant
changes are expected, so until things stabilize, only one version will be
maintained.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-lua-plugins*

Since API is not stable at all, example plugins are stored in code repository
of Vifm and are thus bound to corresponding revision of the application.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-lua-design*

The intent is for Lua to be a way of extending the core.  It's not meant
neither as a replacement of :commands nor as a continuation of it.  Instead
it's supposed to be a more low-level way of interacting with the core.

One implication is that there is no way of calling Lua from :commands or vice
versa.  This gets too ugly too quickly, hence they are separated except for
certain well-defined extension points where Lua parts integrate with
:commands.

Therefore one should think of :commands as a user-facing interface and Lua
part as an internal extension language with wider range of possibilities.

The API is synchronous.  Asynchronous API has some inherent issues due to
invariant invalidation (by the time callback is executed everything might have
changed), which is quite dangerous when dealing with file systems.  That said,
some safe version of asynchronous execution might be made available if safe
way of implementing it exists (need to sandbox callbacks somehow).  All
callback-based mechanisms are susceptible to this issue, but asynchronous API
makes it much worse because these callbacks are created all the time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-lua-libs*

The following standard libraries are enabled:
 * basic
 * table manipulation
 * string manipulation
 * input and output
 * mathematical functions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-plugins*

After processing of |vifm-vifmrc| contents of the $VIFM/plugins/ directory is
enumerated in search of plugins.  Directories or symbolic links to directories
are considered as candidates.

Implications of the (current) order of initialization:
 * :commands defined in configuration have precedence over :commands defined by
   plugins
 * :commands from plugins can't be used during startup

All plugins are required to contain `init.lua` file at their root.  This file
gets processed and its return value is interpreted as plugin data.  The return
value must be a table.  The table is stored in a `vifm.plugins.all` dictionary
with a key that corresponds to the plugin's name.  At the moment the name of a
plugin is the name of its directory.

Global variables created by one plugin are local to that plugin and won't
affect or be visible to other plugins.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-lua-api*

Builtin `print()` function puts messages to plugin's log (see |vifm-:plugins|
menu).

All API calls can raise errors on generic internal issues or when argument
are missing or have wrong type, table keys are missing or have wrong type.

Interaction with the host happens through `vifm` global table.  See |vifm-l_vifm|.

Some ideas~

Use camelCase?
Use tables more often?  Supposed to be more extensible.
Make "description" a mandatory argument?

Add VifmJob:succeeded() ?
Add VifmJob:haserrors() ?
