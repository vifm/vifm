--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-lua-status*

Pre-pre-alpha.  Just figuring out the basics, trying things out and shaping
the design.  API is nowhere near being complete and there are some weird
ideas which can significantly affect their structure.

There is no manual page that corresponds to this document.  Rather significant
changes are expected, so until things stabilize, only one version will be
maintained.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-lua-plugins*

Since API is not stable at all, example plugins are stored in code repository
of Vifm and are thus bound to corresponding revision of the application.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-lua-why*

Think of Lua API as a way to reach deeper into the internals of Vifm.  This
isn't a replacement of existing functionality, but a richer way of interacting
with the core behind it.

One of the primary motivations were deficiencies in integrations with external
applications.  Communicating results of calling them back to Vifm was
problematic, there was simply no good way of doing it reliably.

Regular :commands are a form of user-interface by design, which has various
implications that limit their abilities.  For example, you can't reliably check
if a command succeeded and different commands treat same arguments differently
for the purpose of ease of use, which however makes automation harder.  When
things like that start to get in the way, it's a good idea to reimplement
relevant functionality in Lua.

On top of that user's preferences differ and contradict each other, this can
lead to proliferation of options to account for very fine-grained details.
It's better to let users implement their wild and highly specific ideas on their
own rather than trying to squeeze all possible use case into the application.
The useful functionality developed on the side can eventually make its way to
the code base.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-lua-design*

The intent is for Lua to be a way of extending the core.  It's not meant
neither as a replacement of :commands nor as a continuation of it.  Instead
it's supposed to be a more low-level way of interacting with the core and
extension.

One implication is that there is no way of calling Lua from :commands or vice
versa.  This gets too ugly too quickly, hence they are separated except for
certain well-defined extension points where Lua parts integrate with
:commands.

Therefore one should think of :commands as a user-facing interface and Lua
part as an internal extension language with wider range of possibilities.

The API is synchronous.  Asynchronous API has some inherent issues due to
invariant invalidation (by the time callback is executed everything might have
changed), which is quite dangerous when dealing with file systems.  That said,
some safe version of asynchronous execution might be made available if safe
way of implementing it exists (need to sandbox callbacks somehow).  All
callback-based mechanisms are susceptible to this issue, but asynchronous API
makes it much worse because these callbacks are created all the time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-lua-loading*

There are two lists of plugins that affect plugin loading: whitelist and
blacklist.  Here's how they function:
 1. If whitelist isn't empty, only plugins in the list can be loaded.  Trying to
    load any other plugin fails.  Contents of blacklist is ignored.
 2. If whitelist is empty and blacklist isn't, loading anything that's not in
    the blacklist is allowed.

The whitelist is meant to help testing plugins in isolation for debugging
purposes.

The blacklist can be used to temporarily disable broken or just unused plugins
as well as for debugging.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-lua-libs*

The following standard libraries are enabled:
 * basic
 * table manipulation
 * string manipulation
 * input and output
 * mathematical functions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-plugins*

After processing of |vifm-vifmrc| contents of the $VIFM/plugins/ directory is
enumerated in search of plugins.  Directories or symbolic links to directories
are considered as candidates.

Implications of the (current) order of initialization:
 * :commands defined in configuration have precedence over :commands defined by
   plugins
 * :commands from plugins can't be used during startup

All plugins are required to contain `init.lua` file at their root.  This file
gets processed and its return value is interpreted as plugin data.  The return
value must be a table.  The table is stored in a `vifm.plugins.all` dictionary
with a key that corresponds to the plugin's name.  At the moment the name of a
plugin is the name of its directory.

Global variables created by one plugin are local to that plugin and won't
affect or be visible to other plugins.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-lua-api*

Builtin `print()` function puts messages to plugin's log (see |vifm-:plugins|
menu).

All API calls can raise errors on generic internal issues or when argument
are missing or have wrong type, table keys are missing or have wrong type.

Interaction with the host happens through `vifm` global table.  See |vifm-l_vifm|.

Some ideas~

Use camelCase?
Use tables more often?  Supposed to be more extensible.
Make "description" a mandatory argument?

Add VifmJob:succeeded() ?
Add VifmJob:haserrors() ?

Map options to arrays when possible, like for set options ?
Forbid use of option abbreviations ?
Technically options are also part of user-interface and maybe shouldn't be
exposed in this way.

Retrieves data collected from error stream of the job.  It's accumulated
automatically in background and contains all data collected so far, the call
doesn't wait for arrival of data.  Empty if `mergestreams` was set to `true`.

Return:~
  Returns a string.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-l_VifmView*

Instances of this type are returned by |vifm-l_vifm.currview()|.

The corresponding view exists independently of this type and once the view is
gone (e.g., its tab is closed) accessing bound instance raises an error.

VifmView.locopts                               *vifm-l_VifmView.viewopts*
Equivalent of |vifm-l_vifm.opts.global| for location-specific values of
view-specific options.  These are "local" values of view-specific options,
which are reset to "global" ones on file list change.

VifmView.viewopts                              *vifm-l_VifmView.locopts*
Equivalent of |vifm-l_vifm.opts.global| for view-specific options, see there
for details.  These are "global" values of view-specific options.

VifmView:cd({path})                            *vifm-l_VifmView:cd()*
