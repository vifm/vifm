--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-options*

General format:
vifm [OPTION]... [ LWIN_DIR [ RWIN_DIR ] ]

The vifm executable will start vifm in the current directory unless it is
given a different directory on the command line.

vifm /path/to/directory/one
or
vifm /path/to/directory/one /path/to/directory/two

Specifying two directories triggers split view even when vifm was in
single-view mode on finishing previous session.  To suppress this behaviour
|vifm-:only| command can be put in the vifmrc file.

When only one path argument is found on command-line, the left/top pane is
automatically set as the current view.


                                               *vifm---select*
Paths to files are also allowed in case you want vifm to start with some
archive opened.  If you want to select file, prepend its path with --select.

The other command line arguments are:
                                               *vifm--f*
-f - only used from the vifm.vim script.  The selected files are written
    to $VIFM/vimfiles and vifm exits.

--logging                                      *vifm---logging*
    log some errors to $VIFM/log.
    Also /var/log/vifm-startup-log (on *nix) and startup-log in the directory
    of executable (on Windows) is used to log startup process (when
    configuration directory isn't determined).
--remote                                       *vifm---remote*
    sends the rest of command line to the active vifm server (one of already
    running instances if any).  When there is no server, quits silently.
    There is no limit on how many arguments can be processed.  One can
    combine --remote with -c <command> or +<command> to execute command in
    already running instance of vifm.  See also |vifm-clientserver|.
-c <command>, +<command>                       *vifm--c* *vifm--+c*
    run command-line mode <command> on startup.  Commands in such arguments
    are executed in the order they appear in command line.  Commands with
    spaces or special symbols must be enclosed in double or single quotes or
    all special symbols should be escaped (the exact syntax strongly depends
    on shell).
--help, -h                                     *vifm---help* *vifm--h*
    show a brief command summary and exit vifm.
--version, -v                                  *vifm---version* *vifm--v*
    show the version information and exit.
--no-configs                                   *vifm---no-configs*
    don't read vifmrc and vifminfo.

See |vifm-startup| section below for the explanations on |vifm-$VIFM|.

Ctrl-W x - exchange panes.                     *vifm-CTRL-W_x*
Ctrl-W z - quit preview pane or view modes.    *vifm-CTRL-W_z*

Ctrl-W + - increase size of the view by count. *vifm-CTRL-W_+*
Ctrl-W - - decrease size of the view by count. *vifm-CTRL-W_-*

For Ctrl-W +, Ctrl-W -, Ctrl-W < and Ctrl-W > commands count
can be given before and/or after Ctrl-W.  The resulting count
is a multiplication of those two.  So "2 Ctrl-W 2 - " will
decrease window size by 4 lines or columns.

Marks~

Marks are set the same way as they are in vi.
You can use this characters for marks [a-z][A-Z][0-9].

                                               *vifm-m*
m[a-z][A-Z][0-9] will set a mark at the current cursor position.

                                               *vifm-'*
'[a-z][A-Z][0-9] moves to the file set for the mark.


There are also several special marks that can't be set manually:
 ' (single quote) - previously visited directory of the view, thus hitting
                    '' allows switching between two last locations
 < - the first file of the last visually selected block
 > - the last file of the last visually selected block

Searching~

                                               *vifm-/*
/regular expression - select files matching regular expression. Forward
    search.

                                               *vifm-?*
?regular expression - select files matching regular expression. Backward
    search.

                                               *vifm-n* *vifm-N*
[count]n - go to the next file matching last search pattern.  Takes last
    search direction into account.
[count]N - go to the previous file matching last search pattern.  Takes
    last search direction into account.

    If |vifm-'hlsearch'| is set, hitting n/N to perform search and go to the
    first matching item resets current selection in normal mode.  It is
    not the case if search was already performed on files in the directory,
    thus selection is not reset after clearing selection with escape key
    and hitting n/N key again.

Note: vifm uses extended regular expressions for / and ?.


                                               *vifm-f*
[count]f[character] - search forward for file with [character] as first
    character in name.  Search wraps around the end of the list.

                                               *vifm-F*
[count]F[character] - search backward for file with [character] as first
    character in name.  Search wraps around the end of the list.

                                               *vifm-;*
[count]; - find the next match of f or F.

                                               *vifm-,*
[count], - find the previous match of f or F.

Note: f, F, ; and , wrap around list beginning and end when they are used
alone and they don't wrap when they are used as selectors.

Filters~
                                               *vifm-filters*
There are three basic file filters:
 - dot files filter (excluding "." and ".." special directories, which
   appearance is controlled by the |vifm-'dotdirs'| option)
 - manual filter for file names
 - automatic filter for file names
 - local filter for file names (see |vifm-=|)

Performing operations on manual filter for file names automatically does the
same on automatic one.  The file name filter is separated mainly for
convenience purpose and to get more deterministic behaviour.

The basic vim folding key-bindings are used for filters.

                                               *vifm-za*
za - toggles the showing and hiding of dot files.

                                               *vifm-zo*
zo - show the dot files.

                                               *vifm-zf*
zf - add the selected files to the file name filter.

                                               *vifm-zm*
zm - hide the dot files.

                                               *vifm-zO*
zO - show the hidden by file name filter files.

                                               *vifm-zM*
zM - restore all filters.

                                               *vifm-zR*
zR - remove all filters.

                                               *vifm-=*
=regular expression - filter out files that don't match regular expression.
    This kind of filter is automatically reset when directory is changed.

Each file list has its own copy of each filter.

Filtered files are not checked in / search or :commands.

Files and directories are filtered separately.  For this a slash is appended
to a directory name before testing whether it matches the filter.  Examples:
>
 " filter directories which names end with '.files'
 :filter /^.*\.files/$/

 " filter files which names end with '.d'
 :filter /^.*\.d$/

 " filter files and directories which names end with '.o'
 :filter /^.*\.o\/?$/
<
Note: vifm uses extended regular expressions.

    |vifm-'trash'| is set, otherwise delete).

    file systems, in case you want to move files from fs1 to fs2 and your
    home is on fs3) can save your time.

) - goto next group.  See ( key description above.

Using Count~
                                               *vifm-count* *vifm-[count]*
You can use count with commands like yy.

[count]yy yank (count + 1) files starting from current cursor position
downward.

Or you can use count with motions passed to y, d or D.

d[count]j delete (count + 1) files starting from current cursor position
upward.

Registers~
                                               *vifm-registers*
vifm supports multiple registers for temporary storing list of yanked or
deleted files.

Registers should be specified with hitting double quite key followed by a
register name.  Count is specified after register name.  By default
commands use unnamed register, which has double quote as its name.

Though all commands accept registers, most of commands ignores them (for
example H or Ctrl-U).  Other commands can fill register or append new
files to it.

Presently vifm supports ", _, a-z and A-Z characters as register names.

_ is black hole register.  It can be used for writing, but its list is always
empty.

As mentioned above " is unnamed register and has special meaning of the
default register.  Every time when you use named registers (a-z and A-Z)
unnamed register is updated to contain same list of files as the last
used register.

Registers with names from a to z  and from A to Z are named ones.
Lowercase registers are cleared before adding new files, while uppercase
aren't and should be used to append new files to the existing file list
of appropriate lowercase register (A for a, B for b, ...).

Registers can be changed on :empty command if they contain files under
|vifm-trash| directory.

Registers do not contain one file more than once.

Example:
  "a2yy
will put names of two files to register a (and to the unnamed register).
  "Ad
will remove one file and append its name to register a (and to the
unnamed register).
  p or "ap or "Ap
will insert previously yanked and deleted files into current directory.

Selectors~
                                               *vifm-selectors*
y, d, D, !, gu and gU commands accept selectors.  You can combine them with
any of selectors below to quickly remove or yank several files.

j, k, gg, G, H, L, M, %, f, F, ;, comma, ', ^, 0 and $ can be used as
selectors for several commands.
Also following selectors can be used:
 a - all files in current view
 s - selected files
 S - all files except selected

For example:
dj - delete file under cursor and one below.
d2j - delete file under cursor and two below.
y6gg - yank all files from cursor position to 6th file in the list.

When you pass a count to whole command and its selector they are
multiplied. So:
2d2j - delete file under cursor and four below.
2dj - delete file under cursor and two below.
2y6gg - yank all files from cursor position to 12th file in the list.

In visual mode work almost all normal mode keys, but they do not accept
selectors.

Pasting special values~

The shortcuts listed below insert specified values into current cursor
position.  Last key of every shortcut references value that it inserts:

 - c - [c]urrent file
 - d - [d]irectory path
 - e - [e]xtension of a filename
 - r - [r]oot part of a filename
 - t - [t]ail part of directory path

 - a - [a]utomatic filter
 - m - [m]anual filter
 - = - local filter, which is bound to "=" in normal mode

Values related to filelist in current pane are available through Ctrl-X
prefix, while values from the other pane have doubled Ctrl-X key as their
prefix (doubled Ctrl-X is presumably easier to type than uppercase
letters; it's still easy to remap the keys to correspond to names of
similar macros).

*vifm-command-line-edit*

vifm provides a facility to edit several kinds of data, that is usually edited
in command-line mode, in external editor (using command specified by
|vifm-'vicmd'| or |vifm-'vixcmd'| option).  This has at least two advantages
over built-in command-line mode:
 - one can use full power of Vim to edit text;
 - finding and reusing history entries becomes possible.

The facility is supported by four input submodes of the command-line:
 - command;
 - forward search;
 - backward search;
 - file rename (see |vifm-cw| and |vifm-cW|).

Editing command-line using external editor is activated by the |vifm-c_CTRL-G|
shortcut.  It's also possible to do almost the same from Normal and Visual
modes using |vifm-q:|, |vifm-q/| and |vifm-q?| commands.

Temporary file created for the purpose of editing the line has the following
structure:
 1. First line, which is either empty or contains text already entered in
    command-line.
 2. 2nd and all other lines with history items starting with the most recent
    one.  Altering this lines in any way won't change history items stored by
    vifm.

After editing application is finished the first line of the file is taken as
the result of operation, when the application returns zero exit code.  If the
application returns an error (see |:cquit| command in Vim), all the edits made
to the file are ignored, but the initial value of the first line is saved in
appropriate history.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-commands*

vifm-commands are executed with :command_name<Return>

Commented out lines should start with the double quote symbol, which may be
preceded by whitespace characters.

Most of the commands have two forms: complete and the short one.
Example: >
    :noh[lsearch]
This means the complete command is nohlsearch, and the short one is noh.

                                               *vifm-commands-and-selection*
Most of command-line commands completely reset selection in the current view.
However, there are several exceptions:
 - ":invert s" will most likely leave some files selected;
 - :if and :else commands doesn't affect selection on successful execution.

                                               *vifm-:bar*
'|' can be used to separate commands, so you can give multiple commands in one
line.  If you want to use '|' in an argument, precede it with '\'.

These commands see '|' as part of their arguments even when it's escaped:

    :[range]!
    :cmap
    :cnoremap
    :command
    :filetype
    :fileviewer
    :filextype
    :map
    :mmap
    :mnoremap
    :nmap
    :nnoremap
    :noremap
    :normal
    :qmap
    :qnoremap
    :vmap
    :vnoremap
    :windo
    :winrun

To be able to use another command after one of these, wrap it with the
|vifm-:execute| command.  An example: >

    if filetype('.') == 'reg' | execute '!!echo regular file' | endif
<
                                               *vifm-:range*
:number - move to the file number.
:12 would move to the 12th file in the list.
:0 move to the top of the list.
:$ move to the bottom of the list.
See |vifm-ranges| for the ranges implemented.

:[count]command
The only builtin :[count]command are :[count]d[elete] and :[count]y[ank].
Examples:
:d3 - would delete three files starting at the current file position
    moving down.
:3d - would delete one file at the third line in the list.

See |vifm-reserved| for a list of reserved command names.

The builtin commands are:
                                               *vifm-:!*
:[range]!program - shellout and execute program.
    :!command & will run the process in the background using vifm's means.
    Programs that write to stdout like ls will create an error message
    showing partial output of the command.
    Take note of the space before ampersand symbol, if you omit it, command
    will be run in the background using job control of shell.
    Accepts macros.
                                               *vifm-:!!*
:[range]!!program - same as :! but will pause before returning.

    overwrite.
:[range]alink[!] path - creates absolute symbolic links of files in directory
    specified with the path (absolute or relative to directory of other
    view).
:[range]alink[!] name1 name2... - creates absolute symbolic links of files in
    directory of other view giving each next link a corresponding name from
    the argument list.

                                               *vifm-:apropos*
:apropos manpage - will create a menu of items returned by the apropos
    command.  Selecting an item in the menu will open the corresponding
    manpage.  By default the command relies on the external "apropos"
    utility, which can be customized by altering value of the
    |vifm-'aproposprg'| option.
:apropos - repeats last :apropos command.

                                               *vifm-:cd*

    vifm assumes that both of them are relative to current directory of current
    view.  Command will not fail if one of directories is invalid.
    Accepts macros.
:cd! /dir - same as :cd /dir /dir.

                                               *vifm-:change* *vifm-:c*

:[range]clone[!?] - clones files in current directory.  With "?" vifm will
    open vi to edit filenames.  "!" forces overwrite.  Macros are expanded.
:[range]clone[!] path - clones files to directory specified with the path
    (absolute or relative to current directory).  Macros are expanded.
:[range]clone[!] name1 name2... - clones files in current directory giving
    each next clone a corresponding name from the argument list.  Macros
    are expanded.

                                               *vifm-:colorscheme* *vifm-:colo*
:colo[rscheme]? - prints current color scheme name in the status bar.
:colo[rscheme] - gives a menu with a list of available color schemes.  You

    set border color (except view titles) and colors in the menus and
    dialogs.
:colo[rscheme] color_scheme_name - changes default color scheme to
    color_scheme_name.
:colo[rscheme] color_scheme_name directory - associates directory with the
    color scheme.  The directory argument can be both absolute or relative
    path when :colorscheme command is executed from command line, but
    mandatory should be an absolute path when the command is executed in
    scripts loaded at startup (until vifm is completely loaded).

                                               *vifm-:comclear* *vifm-:comc*

    Unlike vim user commands do not have to start with a capital letter.
    User commands are run in a shell by default.  To run a command in
    the background you must set it as a background command with & at the end
    of the commands action (:com rm rm %f &).  Command name cannot contain
    numbers or special symbols (except '?' and '!').
:com[mand] name /pattern - will set search pattern.
:com[mand] name filter pattern - will set file name filter.
:com[mand] cmd :commands - will set kind of alias for internal command (like

                                               *vifm-:filetype* *vifm-:filet*
:filet[ype] pat1,pat2,... [{ descr }]def_program[ &],[{ descr }]prog2[ &],...
    will associate given program list to each of the patterns.  Associated
    program (command) is used by handlers of l and Enter keys (and also in
    the :file menu).  If you need to insert comma into command just double
    it (",,").  Space followed by an ampersand as two last characters of
    a command means running of the command in the background.  Optional
    description can be given to each command to ease understanding of what
    command will do in the :file menu.  Vifm will try the rest of the
    programs for an association when the default isn't found.  When program
    entry doesn't contain any of vifm macros, name of current file is
    appended as if program entry ended with %c macro on *nix and %"c on
    Windows.  On Windows path to executables containing spaces can (and
    should be for correct work with such paths) be double quoted.  See
    |vifm-globs| for pattern definition.  See also |vifm-fuse|.  Example for
    zip archives and several actions: >

    filetype *.zip,*.jar,*.war,*.ear
           \ {Mount with fuse-zip}
           \ FUSE_MOUNT|fuse-zip %SOURCE_FILE %DESTINATION_DIR,
           \ {View contents}
           \ zip -sf %c | less,
           \ {Extract here}
           \ tar -xf %c,
<
                                               *vifm-:filextype* *vifm-:filex*
:filex[type] pat1,pat2,... [{ description }] def_program,program2,... - same
    as :filetype, but vifm will ignore this command if it's not running in X.
    In X :filextype is equal to :filetype.  See |vifm-globs| for pattern
    definition.  See also |vifm-fuse|.

    For example, consider the following settings (the order might seem
    strange, but it's for the demonstration purpose): >

    filetype *.html,*.htm
            \ {View in lynx}
            \ lynx
    filextype *.html,*.htm
            \ {Open with dwb}
            \ dwb %f %i &,
    filetype *.html,*.htm
            \ {View in links}
            \ links
    filextype *.html,*.htm
            \ {Open with firefox}
            \ firefox %f &,
            \ {Open with uzbl}
            \ uzbl-browser %f %i &,
<
    If you're using vifm inside a terminal emulator that is running in
    graphical environment (when X is used on *nix; always on Windows), vifm
    will attempt to run application in this order:

    1. lynx
    2. dwb
    3. links
    4. firefox
    5. uzbl

    If there is no graphical environment (checked presence of $DISPLAY
    environment variable on *nix; never happens on Windows), the list will
    look like:

    1. lynx

    Just as if all :filextype commands were not there.

    The purpose of such differentiation is to allow comfortable use of vifm
    with same settings in desktop environment/through remote connection (SSH)/
    in native console.

                                               *vifm-:fileviewer* *vifm-:filev*
:filev[iewer] pat1,pat2,... command - will associate given command as a
    viewer to each of the patterns.  Viewer is a command which output is
    captured and showed in the second pane of vifm after running :view
    command.  When the command doesn't contain any of vifm macros, name of
    current file is appended as if command ended with %c macro.  See
    |vifm-globs| for pattern definition.  Example for zip archives: >

    fileviewer *.zip,*.jar,*.war,*.ear zip -sf %c
<
                                               *vifm-:filter*
:filter[!] regular_expression
:filter[!] /regular_expression/ - will filter files matching the pattern
    out of directory listing.  Use :filter to show all files.  Using second
    variant you can use the bar ('|') symbol without escaping.  Empty
    regular expression (specified by //, "" or '') means using of the last
    search pattern.  Use '!' to control state of filter inversion after
    updating filter value (see |vifm-cpo-f|).  Filter is matched case
    sensitively on *nix and case insensitively on Windows.
    See |vifm-filters|.
:filter - reset filter (set it to empty string) and show all files.
:filter! - same as :invert.
:filter? - show current value of local, name and auto filters.

                                               *vifm-:find* *vifm-:fin*
:[range]fin[d] pattern - will show results of find command in the menu.
    Searches among selected files if any and no range given.
    Accepts macros.  By default the command relies on the external "find"
    utility, which can be customized by altering value of the
    |vifm-'findprg'| option.
:[range]fin[d] -opt... - same as :find above, but user defines all find
    arguments.  Searches among selected files if any and no range given.
:[range]fin[d] path -opt... - same as :find above, but user defines all
    find arguments.  Ignores selection and range.
:[range]fin[d] - repeats last :find command.

                                               *vifm-:finish* *vifm-:fini*
:fini[sh] - stop sourcing a script. Can only be used in a vifm script
    file. This is a quick way to skip the rest of the file.

                                               *vifm-:grep* *vifm-:gr*
:[range]gr[ep][!] pattern - will show results of grep command in the menu.
    Add "!" to request inversion of search (look for lines that do not
    match pattern).  Searches among selected files if any and no range
    given.  Ignores binary files by default.  By default the command
    relies on the external "grep" utility, which can be customized by
    altering value of the |vifm-'grepprg'| option.
:[range]gr[ep][!] -opt... - same as :grep above, but user defines all find
    arguments, which are not escaped.  Searches among selected files if
    any.
:[range]gr[ep][!] - repeats last :grep command.  "!" of this command
    inverts "!" in repeated command.

                                               *vifm-:help* *vifm-:h*
:h[elp] - show the help file.
:h[elp] argument - is the same as using ':h argument' in vim.  Use
    vifm-<something> to get help on vifm (tab completion works).  This
    form of the command doesn't work when |vifm-'vimhelp'| option is off.

                                               *vifm-:highlight* *vifm-:hi*
:hi[ghlight] - will show information about all highlight groups in the
    current directory.
:hi[ghlight] group-name - will show information on given highlight
    group of the default color scheme.
:hi[ghlight] group-name cterm=style | ctermfg=color | ctermbg=color - sets
    style (cterm), foreground (ctermfg) or/and background (ctermbg)
    parameters of highlight group of the current default color scheme.

Available style values (some of them can be combined):
 - bold
 - underline
 - reverse or inverse
 - standout
 - none

Available group-name values:
 - Win - color of all windows (views, dialogs, menus)
 - Border - color of vertical parts of the border
 - TopLineSel - top line color of the current pane
 - TopLine - top line color of the other pane
 - CmdLine - the command line/status bar color
 - ErrorMsg - color of error messages in the status bar
 - StatusLine - color of the line above the status bar
 - WildMenu - color of the wild menu items
 - CurrLine - line at cursor position in the view
 - Selected - color of selected files
 - Directory - color of directories
 - Link - color of symbolic links in the views
 - BrokenLink - color of broken symbolic links
 - Socket - color of sockets
 - Device - color of block and character devices
 - Executable - color of executable files
 - Fifo - color of fifo pipes

Available colors:
 - -1 or default or none - transparent
 - black   and lightblack
 - red     and lightred
 - green   and lightgreen
 - yellow  and lightyellow
 - blue    and lightblue
 - magenta and lightmagenta
 - cyan    and lightcyan
 - white   and lightwhite

Light versions of colors are regular colors with bold attribute set.  So order
of arguments of :highlight command is important and it's better to put "cterm"
in front of others to prevent it from overwriting attributes set by "ctermfg" or
"ctermbg" arguments.

Since there are two colors and only one bold attribute it affects both colors
when "reverse" attribute is used when running vifm in terminal emulator.  While
linux native console can handle boldness of foreground and background colors
independently, which is for consistency with terminal emulators accessible from
vifm only implicitly by using light versions of colors.

Here is the hierarchy of highlight groups, which you need to know for using
transparency:
  StatusLine
    WildMenu
  Border
  CmdLine
    ErrorMsg
  Win
    Directory
    Link
    BrokenLink
    Socket
    Device
    Fifo
    Executable
      Selected
        CurrLine
  TopLine
    TopLineSel

"none" means default terminal color for highlight groups at the first level
of the hierarchy and transparency for all others.

:locate filename - uses the locate command to create a menu of filenames
    Selecting a file from the menu will reload the current file list in vifm
    to show the selected file.  By default the command relies on the

    built), which can be customized by altering value of the
    |vifm-'locateprg'| option.
:locate - repeats last :locate command.

:ls - lists windows of active terminal multiplexer (only when terminal
    multiplexer is used).  This is achieved by issuing proper command for
    active terminal multiplexer, thus the list is not handled by vifm.

:screen - toggles whether to use the terminal multiplexer or not.
    A terminal multiplexer uses pseudo terminals to allow multiple windows
    to be used in the console or in a single xterm.  Starting vifm from
    terminal multiplexer with appropriate support turned on will cause vifm
    to open a new terminal multiplexer window for each new file edited or
    program launched from vifm.  This requires screen version 3.9.9 or newer
    for the screen -X argument or tmux (version or newer 1.8 is recommented).
:screen? - shows whether integration with terminal multiplexers is enabled.

Note: the command is called screen for historical reasons (when tmux wasn't
yet supported) and might be changed in future releases, or get an alias.

:se[t] all - shows all options.
:se[t] opt1=val1 opt2='val2' opt3="val3" ... - sets given options.
    You can use following syntax:
     - for all options - option, option? and option&
     - for boolean options - nooption, invoption and option!
     - for integer options - option=x, option+=x and option-=x
     - for string options - option=x
     - for string list options - option=x, option+=x and option-=x
     - for enumeration options - option=x, option+=x and option-=x
     - for enumeration options - option=x
     - for set options - option=x, option+=x and option-=x
     - for charset options - option=x, option+=x and option-=x
    the meaning:
     - option - turn option on (for boolean) or print its value (for all
         others)
     - nooption - turn option off
     - invoption - invert option state
     - option! - invert option state
     - option? - print option value
     - option& - reset option to its default value
     - option=x or option:x - set option to x
     - option+=x - add x to option
     - option-=x - remove (or subtract) x from option

    Option name can be prepended and appended by any number of whitespace
    characters.

Ranges~
                                                               *vifm-ranges*
The ranges implemented include:
  2,3 - from second to third file in the list (including it)
  % - the entire directory.
  . - the current position in the filelist.
  $ - the end of the filelist.
  't - the mark position t.

Examples:
  :%delete would delete all files in the directory.
  :2,4delete would delete the files in the list positions 2 through 4.
  :.,$delete would delete the files from the current position to the end
    of the filelist.
  :3delete4 would delete the files in the list positions 3, 4, 5, 6.

If a backward range is given :4,2delete - an query message is given and
user can chose what to do next.

The builtin commands that accept a range are :d[elete] and :y[ank].

Command macros~
                                                               *vifm-macros*
The command macros may be used in user commands.
                                                               *vifm-%a*
  %a        user arguments.  When user arguments contain macros, they are
            expanded before preforming substitution of %a.
                                                               *vifm-%c*
  %c  %"c   the current file under the cursor.
                                                               *vifm-%C*
  %C  %"C   the current file under the cursor in the other directory.
                                                               *vifm-%f*
  %f  %"f   all of the selected files.
                                                               *vifm-%F*
  %F  %"F   all of the selected files in the other directory list.
                                                               *vifm-%b*
  %b  %"b   same as %f %F.
                                                               *vifm-%d*
  %d  %"d   full path to current directory.
                                                               *vifm-%D*
  %D  %"D   full path to other file list directory.
                                                               *vifm-%r*
  %rx %"rx  full paths to files in the register {x}.  In case of invalid
            symbol in place of {x}, it's processed with the rest of the
            line and default register is used.
                                                               *vifm-%m*
  %m        show command output in a menu.
                                                               *vifm-%M*
  %M        same as %m, but l (or Enter) key is handled like for :locate
            and :find commands.
                                                               *vifm-%S*
  %S        show command output in the status bar.
                                                               *vifm-%s*
  %s        execute command in split window of active terminal
            multiplexer (ignored if not running inside one).
                                                               *vifm-%n*
  %n        forbid using of terminal multiplexer to run the command.
                                                               *vifm-%i*
  %i        completely ignore command output.

Use %% if you need to put a percent sign in your command.

Note that %m, %M, %s, %S and %i macros are mutually exclusive.  Only the
last one of them in the command will take effect.

You can use filename modifiers after %c, %C, %f, %F, %b, %d and %D macros.
Supported modifiers are:
    :p           - full path
    :u           - UNC name of path (e.g. "\\server" in "\\server\share"),
                   Windows only.  Expands to current computer name for not
                   UNC paths.
    :~           - relative to the home directory
    :.           - relative to current directory
    :h           - head of the filename
    :t           - tail of the filename
    :r           - root of the filename (without last extension)
    :e           - extension of the filename (last one)
    :s?pat?sub?  - substitute the first occurrence of "pat" with "sub".  You
                   can use any character for '?', but it must not occur in pat
                   or sub
    :gs?pat?sub? - like :s, but substitutes all occurrences of "pat" with
                   "sub".
See |filename-modifiers| for the detailed description.

Using %x means expand corresponding macro escaping all characters that have
special meaning.  And %"x means using of double quotes and escape only backslash
and double quote characters, which is more useful on Windows systems.

Position and quantity (if there is any) of %m, %M, %S or %s macros in the
command is unimportant.  All their occurrences will be removed from the
resulting command.

%c and %f macros are expanded to file names only, when %C and %F are expanded
to full paths.  %f and %F follow this in %b too.

:com move mv %f %D - would set the :move command to move all of the files
selected in the current directory to the other directory.

The %a macro will substitute any arguments given in a command into the
command.  All arguments are considered optional.
:com lsl !!ls -l %a - will set the lsl command to execute ls -l with or
without an argument.

:lsl<Return> will list the directory contents of the current directory.
:lsl filename<Return> will list only the given filename.

The macros can also be used in directly executing commands.
:!mv %f %D - would move the current directory selected files to the other
directory.

Appending & to the end of a command will cause it to be executed in the
background.  Typically you want to run two kinds of external commands in the
background:
 - GUI applications that doesn't fork thus block vifm (:!sxiv %f &);
 - console tools that do not work with terminal (:!mv %f %D &).
You don't want to run terminal commands, which require terminal input or
output something because they will mess up vifm's TUI. Anyway, if you did run
such a command, you can use Ctrl-L key to update vifm's TUI.

Rewriting the example command with macros given above with backgrounding:
>
 :!mv %f %D &
<
Note that %m, %M, %s, %S and %i macros have bigger priority than &.  So
command containing at least one of them can't be backgrounded and " &" at the
end will be just silently ignored.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-commands-bg*

Copy and move operation can take a lot of time to proceed.  That's why vifm
supports backgrounding of this two operations.  To run :copy, :move or :delete
command in the background just add " &" at the end of a command.

For each background operation a new thread will be created.  Currently job
cannot be stopped or paused.

You can see if command is still running in the :jobs menu.  Backgrounded
commands have progress instead of process id at the line beginning.

Background operations cannot be undone.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-cancellation*

Note that cancellation works somewhat different on Windows platform due to
different mechanism of break signal propagation.  One also might need to use
Ctrl-Break shortcut instead of Ctrl-C.

There are two types of operations that can be cancelled:
 - file system operations;
 - calls of external applications.

Note that vifm never terminates applications, it sends SIGINT signal and lets
the application quit normally.

When one of set of operations is cancelled (e.g. copying of 5th file of 10
files), further operations are cancelled too.  In this case undo history will
contain only actually performed operations.

Cancelled operations are indicated by "(cancelled)" suffix appended to
information message on statusbar.

File system operations~

Currently the following commands can be cancelled: |vifm-:alink|, |vifm-:chmod|,
|vifm-:chown|, |vifm-:clone|, |vifm-:copy|, |vifm-:delete|, |vifm-:mkdir|, |vifm-:move|,
|vifm-:restore|, |vifm-:rlink|, |vifm-:touch|.  File putting (|vifm-p|, |vifm-P|) can
be cancelled as well.  It's not hard to see that these are mainly
long-running operations.

Cancelling commands when they are repeated for undo/redo operations is allowed
for convenience, but is not recommended as further undo/redo operations might
get blocked by side-effects of partially cancelled group of operations.

These commands can't be cancelled: |vifm-:empty|, |vifm-:rename|,
|vifm-:substitute|, |vifm-:tr|.

External application calls~

Each of this operations can be cancelled: |vifm-:apropos|, |vifm-:find|,
|vifm-:grep|, |vifm-:locate|.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-globs*

|vifm-:filetype|, |vifm-:filextype| and |vifm-:fileviewer| commands support globs
to match file names.  Here is a short overview of globs and some important
points that one needs to know about them.

Only names of files are matched by the globs, not full paths.  E.g. >
 :filetype Makefile make %c
will match files with name "Makefile" regardless whether it's in root or home
directory.

*, ?, [ and ] are treated as special symbols in the pattern.  E.g. >
 :filetype * less %c
matches all files.  One can use character classes for escaping, so >
 :filetype [*] less %c
matches only one file name, the one which contains only asterisk symbol.

* means any number of any characters (possibly an empty substring), with one
exception: asterisk at the pattern beginning doesn't match dot in the first
position.  E.g. >
 :fileviewer *.zip,*.jar zip -sf %c
associates using of zip program to preview all files with zip or jar
extensions as listing of their content.

? means any character at this position.  E.g. >
 :fileviewer ?.out file %c
calls file tool for all files which has exactly one character before their
extension (e.g. a.out, b.out).

Square brackets designate character class, which means that whole character
class matches against any of characters listed in it.  For example >
 :fileviewer *.[ch] highlight -O xterm256 -s dante --syntax c %c
makes vifm call highlight program to colorize source and header files in C
language for a 256-color terminal.  Equal command would be >
 :fileviewer *.c,*.h highlight -O xterm256 -s dante --syntax c %c

Inside square brackets ^ or ! can be used for symbol class negotiation and
the - symbol to set a range. ^ and ! should appear right after the opening
square bracket.  For example >
 :filetype *.[!d]/ inspect_dir
associates inspect_dir as additional handler for all directories that have one
character extension unless it's "d" letter.  And >
 :filetype [0-9].jpg sxiv
associates sxiv picture viewer only for JPEG-files that contain single digit
in their name.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-set-options*

                                               *vifm-local-options*
These are kind of options that are local to a specific view. So you can set
ascending sorting order for left pane and descending order for right pane.

                                               *vifm-'aproposprg'*
aproposprg
type: string
default: "apropos %a"
Specifies format for an external command to be invoked by the |vifm-:apropos|
command.  The format supports expanding of macros, specific for a particular
*prg option, and %% sequence for inserting percent sign literally.  This
option should include the %a macro to specify placement of arguments passed
to the |vifm-:apropos| command.  If the macro is not used, it will be
implicitly added after a space to the value of this option.

                                               *vifm-'autochpos'*
autochpos
type: boolean
default: true
When disabled vifm will set cursor to the first line in the view after :cd and
:pushd commands instead of saved cursor position.  Disabling this will also
make vifm clear information about cursor position in the view history on :cd
and :pushd commands (and on startup if 'autochpos' is disabled in the vifmrc).
l key in the ":history ." and ":trashes" menus is treated like :cd command.
This option also affects bookmarks so that navigating to a bookmark doesn't
restore cursor position.

                                               *vifm-'classify'*
classify
type: string list
default: ":dir:/"
Specifies file name prefixes and suffixes depending on file types.  The format
is: [{prefix}]:{filetype}:[{suffix}].  Either {prefix} or {suffix} or both of
them can be omitted (which is the default for all unspecified file types),
this means empty {prefix} and/or {suffix}.  {prefix} and {suffix} should
consist exactly of one character. Elements are separated by commas.  Neither
prefixes nor suffixes are part of file names, so they don't affect commands
which operate on file names in any way. Comma (',') character should not be
used.  List of file type names can be found in the description of
|vifm-filetype()| function.

                                               *vifm-'columns'* *vifm-'co'*
columns co
type: int
default: terminal width on startup
Terminal width in characters.

                                               *vifm-'confirm'* *vifm-'cf'*
confirm cf
type: boolean
default: true
Ask about permanent deletion of files (on D or :delete! command or on
undo/redo operation).

                                               *vifm-'cpoptions'* *vifm-'cpo'*
cpoptions cpo
type: charset
default: "fst"
Contains a sequence of single-character flags.  Each flag enables behaviour of
older versions of vifm.  Flags:
                                               *vifm-cpo-f*
f - when included, running |vifm-:filter| command results in not inverted
    (matching files are filtered out) and :filter! in inverted (matching files
    are left) filter, when omitted, meaning of the exclamation mark changes to
    the opposite;
                                               *vifm-cpo-s*
s - when included, |vifm-yy|, |vifm-dd| and |vifm-DD| normal mode commands act on
    selection, otherwise they operate on current file only;
                                               *vifm-cpo-t*
t - when included, <tab> (thus <c-i>) behave as <space> and switch active
    pane, otherwise <c-i> goes forward in the view history.

                                               *vifm-'dotdirs'*
dotdirs
type: set
default: nonrootparent
Controls displaying of dot directories.  The following values are possible:
   rootparent    - show "../" in root directory of file system
   nonrootparent - show "../" in non-root directories of file system
Note that empty directories will always contain "../" entry regardless of value
of this option.  "../" will disappear at the moment at least one file is created
inside the directory.

                                               *vifm-'fastrun'*
fastrun
type: boolean
default: false
With this option turned on you can run partially entered commands with
unambiguous beginning using :! (e.g. :!Te instead of :!Terminal or :!Te<tab>).

                                               *vifm-'findprg'*
findprg
type: string
default: "find %s %a -print , -type d \( ! -readable -o ! -executable \) -prune"
Specifies format for an external command to be invoked by the |vifm-:find|
command.  The format supports expanding of macros, specific for a particular
*prg option, and %% sequence for inserting percent sign literally.  This
option should include the %s macro to specify placement of list of paths to
search in and %a or %A macro to specify placement of arguments passed to the
|vifm-:find| command.  If some of the macros are not used, they will be
implicitly added after a space to the value of the option in the following
order: %s, %a.  Note that when neither %a nor %A are specified, it's %a which
is added implicitly.

The macros can slightly change their meaning depending on |vifm-:find| command
arguments.  When the first argument points to an existing directory, %s is
assigned all arguments and %a/%A are left empty.  Otherwise, %s is assigned
a dot (".") meaning current directory or list of selected filenames, if any.
%a/%A are assigned arguments when first argument starts with a dash ("-"),
otherwise %a gets an escaped version of arguments, prepended by "-name"
(on *nix) or "-iname" (on Windows) predicate.

%a and %A macros contain almost the same value, the difference is that %a can
be escaped and %A is never escaped.  %A is to be used mainly on Windows, where
shell escaping is a mess and can break command execution.

Starting from Windows Server 2003 a where command is available, one can
configure vifm to use it in the following way: >

    set findprg="where /R %s %A"
<
As the syntax of this command is rather limited, one can't use |vifm-:find|
command with selection of more than one item in this case.  The command looks
for files only completely ignoring directories.

When using find port on Windows, another option is to setup 'findprg' like
this: >
    set findprg="find %s %a"
<
                                               *vifm-'followlinks'*
followlinks
type: boolean
default: true
Follow links on l or Enter.

                                               *vifm-'fusehome'*
fusehome
type: string
default: "($TMPDIR | $TEMP | $TEMPDIR | $TMP)/vifm_FUSE/"
Directory to be used as a root dir for FUSE mounts.  Value of the option can
contain environment variables (in form "$envname"), which will be expanded
(prepend it with a slash to prevent expansion).  The value should expand to
an absolute path.

If you change this option, vifm won't remount anything.  It affects future
mounts only.  See |vifm-fuse| section for more information about FUSE mounts.

                                               *vifm-'gdefault'* |vifm-'gd'|
gdefault gd
type: boolean
When on, 'g' flag is on for |vifm-:substitute| by default.

                                               *vifm-'grepprg'*
grepprg
type: string
default: "grep -n -H -I -r %i %a %s"
Specifies format for an external command to be invoked by the |vifm-:grep|
command.  The format supports expanding of macros, specific for a particular
*prg option, and %% sequence for inserting percent sign literally.  This
option should include the %i macro to specify placement of "-v" string when
inversion of results is requested, %a or %A macro to specify placement of
arguments passed to the |vifm-:grep| command and the %s macro to specify
placement of list of files to search in.  If some of the macros are not
used, they will be implicitly added after a space to the value of the
|vifm-'grepprg'| option in the following order: %i, %a, %s.  Note that when
neither %a nor %A are specified, it's %a which is added implicitly.

See |vifm-'findprg'| for description of difference between %a and %A.

Example of setup to use ack (http://beyondgrep.com/) instead of grep:
>
    set grepprg=ack\ -H\ -r\ %i\ %a\ %s
<
or The Silver Searcher (https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher):
>
    set grepprg=ag\ --line-numbers\ %i\ %a\ %s
<

locateprg
type: string
default: "locate %a"
Specifies format for an external command to be invoked by the |vifm-:locate|
command.  The format supports expanding of macros, specific for a particular
*prg option, and %% sequence for inserting percent sign literally.  This
option should include the %a macro to specify placement of arguments passed
to the |vifm-:locate| command.  If the macro is not used, it will be
implicitly added after a space to the value of this option.

relativenumber rnu
type: boolean
default: false
type: local
Print relative line number in front of each filename when |vifm-'lsview'|
option is turned off.  Use |vifm-'numberwidth'| to control width of line
number.  Various combinations of |vifm-'number'| and |vifm-'relativenumber'|
lead to such results:

                        nonumber               number

scrolloff so
type: int
default: 0
Minimal number of screen lines to keep above and below the cursor.  If you
want cursor line to always be in the middle of the view (except at the
beginning or end of the file list), set this option to some large value
(e.g. 999).

                                               *vifm-'shell'* *vifm-'sh'*

shortmess shm
type: charset
default: ""
Contains a sequence of single-character flags.  Each flag enables shortening
of some message displayed by vifm in the TUI.  Flags:
T - truncate status-bar messages in the middle if they are too long to fit on
    the command line.  "..." will appear in the middle.

                                               *vifm-'slowfs'*
                                               {only for *nix}
slowfs
type: string list
default: ""
A list of mounter fs name beginnings (first column in /etc/mtab or
/proc/mounts) that work too slow for you.  This option can be used to
stop vifm from making some requests to particular kinds of file systems
that can slow down file browsing.  Currently this means don't check if
directory has changed and do not check if target of symbolic links exists.

                                               *vifm-'smartcase'* *vifm-'scs'*
smartcase scs
type: boolean
default: false
Overrides the |vifm-'ignorecase'| option if the search pattern contains at
least one upper case character.  Only used when |vifm-'ignorecase'| option
is enabled.  It doesn't affect file filtering.

                                               *vifm-'sort'*
sort
type: enumeration
default: +name on *nix and +iname on Windows
type: local
Sets list of sorting keys (first item is primary key, second is secondary
key, etc.):
   [+-]ext   - extension
   [+-]name  - name (including extension)
   [+-]iname - name (including extension, ignores case)
   [+-]type  - type (directory < file)
   [+-]gid   - group id (*nix only)
   [+-]gname - group name (*nix only)
   [+-]mode  - mode (*nix only)
   [+-]perms - permissions string (*nix only)
   [+-]uid   - owner id (*nix only)
   [+-]uname - owner name (*nix only)
   [+-]size  - size
   [+-]atime - time accessed (e.g. read, executed)
   [+-]ctime - time changed (changes in metadata, e.g. mode)
   [+-]mtime - time modified (when file contents is changed)

Note: look for st_atime, st_ctime and st_mtime in "man 2 stat" for more
information on time keys.

'+' means ascending sort for this key, and '-' means descending sort.

Value of the option is checked to include default sorting key (name on
*nix, iname on Windows).  When it is absent, the key is appended to the
value of the option.

Type key is somewhat similar in this regard but it's not added implicitly:
when "type" is not specified, sorting behaves as if it was the first key in
the list.  That's why if one wants sorting algorithm to mix directories and
files, "type" should be appended to sorting option, for example like this: >
 set sort+=type
or >
 set sort=-size,type

This option also changes view columns according to primary sorting key set,
unless |vifm-'viewcolumns'| option is not empty.

                                               *vifm-'sortnumbers'*

default: false
Natural sort of (version) numbers within text.

                                               *vifm-'sortorder'*
sortorder
type: enumeration
default: ascending
type: local
Sets sort order for primary key: ascending, descending.

                                               *vifm-'statusline'* *vifm-'stl'*
statusline stl
type: string
default: ""
Determines the content of the status line (the line right above command-line).
Empty string means use same format like in previous versions.  Following macros
are supported:
    %t - file name (considering value of the 'classify' option)
    %A - file attributes (permissions on *nix or properties on Windows)
    %u - user name or uid (if it cannot be resolved)
    %g - group name or gid (if it cannot be resolved)
    %s - file size in human readable format
    %E - size of selected files in human readable format, same as %s when no
         files are selected, except that it will never show size of ../ in
         visual mode, since it cannot be selected
    %d - file modification date (uses |vifm-'timefmt'| option)
    all |vifm-'rulerformat'| macros
Percent sign can be followed by optional minimum field width.  Add '-' before
minimum field width if you want field to be right aligned.

On Windows file properties include next flags (upper case means flag is on):
    A - archive
    H - hidden
    I - content isn't indexed
    R - readonly
    S - system
    C - compressed
    D - directory
    E - encrypted
    P - reparse point (e.g. symbolic link)
    Z - sparse file

type: integer
default: value from curses library
Number of spaces that a Tab in the file counts for.

                                               *vifm-'timefmt'*
timefmt
type: string
default: " %m/%d %H:%M"
Format of time in file list.  See man date or man strftime for details.

                                               *vifm-'trash'*
trash
type: boolean
default: true
Use |vifm-trash| directory.

                                               *vifm-'trashdir'*
trashdir
type: string
default: "$HOME/.vifm/Trash"
List of trash directory path specifications, separated with commas.
Each list item either defines an absolute path to |vifm-trash| directory
or a path relative to a mount point root, when list element starts with "%r/".
Value of the option can contain environment variables (in form "$envname"),
which will be expanded (prepend it with a slash to prevent expansion).
Environment variables are expanded when the option is set.

When new file gets cut (deleted) vifm traverses each element of the option in
the order of their appearance and uses first trash directory that it was able
to create or that is already writable.

Example of customization to get one trash directory per mount point: >
 set trashdir=%r/.vifm-Trash,$HOME/.vifm/Trash
<
Will attempt to create the directory if it does not exist.

                                               *vifm-'timeoutlen'* *vifm-'tm'*

empty view columns to show are chosen automatically using sorting keys
(see |vifm-'sort'|) as a base.  Value of this option is ignored if
|vifm-'lsview'| is set.  See |vifm-column-view| for format description.
An example of setting the options for both panes (note |vifm-windo|
command): >
    windo set viewcolumns=-{name}..,6{size},11{perms}
<
                                               *vifm-'vixcmd'*
vixcmd
type: string
default: value of vicmd
The command used to start vi when in X.  Ampersand sign at the end (regardless

wrapscan ws
type: boolean
default: true
Searches wrap around end of the list.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-mappings*

Since it's not easy to enter special characters there are several special
sequences that can be used in place of them.  They are:

<cr> - Enter key
<esc> - Escape key
<space> - Space key
<nop> - provides a way to disable a mapping (by mapping it to <nop>)
<bs> - Backspace key
<tab> <s-tab> - Tabulation and Shift+Tabulation keys
<home> <end> - Home/End
<left> <right> <up> <down> - Arrow keys
<pageup> <pagedown> - PageUp/PageDown
<del> <delete> - Delete key.  <del> and <delete> mean different codes, but
    <delete> is more common.
<c-a>,<c-b>,...,<c-z>,<c-[>,<c-\>,<c-]>,<c-^>,<c-_> - Control + some key.
<a-a>,<a-b>,...,<a-z> - Alt + some key.
<m-a>,<m-b>,...,<m-z> - Alt + some key.
<a-c-a>,<a-c-b>,...,<a-c-z>                    {only for *nix}
Alt + Ctrl + some key.
<m-c-a>,<m-c-b>,...,<m-c-z>                    {only for *nix}
Alt + Ctrl + some key.
<f0> - <f63> - functional keys
<c-f1>,...,<c-f12>                             {only for MS-Windows}
functional keys with Control key pressed.
<a-f1>,...,<a-f12>                             {only for MS-Windows}
functional keys with Alt key pressed.
<s-f1>,...,<s-f12>                             {only for MS-Windows}
functional keys with Shift key pressed.

vifm removes whitespace characters at the beginning and end of commands.
That's why you may want to use <space> at the end of rhs in mappings.  For
example: >
 cmap <f1> man<space>
will put "man " in line when you hit the <f1> key in the command line mode.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-startup*

On startup vifm determines several variables that are used during the session.
They are determined in the order they appear below.

                                               *vifm-$HOME*
On *nix systems $HOME is normally present and used as is.
On Windows systems vifm tries to find correct home directory in the following
order:
 - $HOME variable;
 - $USERPROFILE variable;
 - a combination of $HOMEDRIVE and $HOMEPATH variables.

                                               *vifm-$VIFM*
vifm tries to find correct configuration directory by checking the following
places:
 - $VIFM variable;
 - parent directory of the executable file (on Windows only);
 - $HOME/.vifm directory;
 - $APPDATA/Vifm directory (on Windows only).

                                               *vifm-$MYVIFMRC*
vifm tries to find correct configuration file by checking the following places:
 - $MYVIFMRC variable;
 - vifmrc in parent directory of the executable file (on Windows only);
 - $VIFM/vifmrc file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-configure*

See |vifm-startup| section above for the explanations on |vifm-$VIFM| and
|vifm-$MYVIFMRC|.

                                               *vifm-vifmrc*
The vifmrc file contains commands that will be executed on vifm startup.  See
|vifm-$MYVIFMRC| variable description for search algorithm used to find vifmrc.
Use it to set settings, mappings, filetypes etc.  To use multi line commands
precede each next line with a slash (whitespace before slash is ignored, but all
spaces at the end of the lines are saved).  For example:
set
    \smartcase
equals "setsmartcase".  When
set<space here>
    \ smartcase
equals "set  smartcase".

                                               *vifm-vifminfo*
The $VIFM/vifminfo file contains session settings.  You may edit it by hand
to change the settings, but it's not recommended to do that, edit vifmrc
instead.  You can control what settings will be saved in vifminfo by setting
|vifm-'vifminfo'| option.  Vifm always writes this file on exit unless
|vifm-'vifminfo'| option is empty.  Bookmarks, commands, histories, filetypes,
fileviewers and registers in the file are merged with vifm configuration.

Generally, runtime configuration has bigger priority during merging, but there
are some exceptions:
 - directory stack stored in the file is not overwritten unless something is
   changed in vifm session that performs merge;
 - each bookmark is marked with a timestamp, so that newer value is not
   overwritten by older one, thus no matter from where bookmark comes, the
   newer one wins.

                                               *vifm-scripts*
The $VIFM/scripts directory can contain shell scripts.  vifm modifies
it's PATH environment variable to let user run those scripts without specifying
full path.  All subdirectories of the $VIFM/scripts will be added to PATH too.
Script in a subdirectory overlaps script with the same name in all its parent
directories.

                                               *vifm-colors*
The $VIFM/colors directory contains color schemes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-fuse*

vifm has a builtin support of automated FUSE file system mounts.  It is
implemented using file associations mechanism.  To enable automated mounts, one
needs to use a specially formated program line in |vifm-:filetype| or
|vifm-:filextype| commands.  Currently two formats are supported:

1) FUSE_MOUNT                                  *vifm-FUSE_MOUNT*
   This format should be used in case when all information needed for mounting
   all files of a particular type is the same.  E.g. mounting of tar files
   don't require any file specific options.

   Format line:
       FUSE_MOUNT|mounter %SOURCE_FILE %DESTINATION_DIR [%CLEAR]

   Example |vifm-:filetype| command: >
       :filetype FUSE_MOUNT|fuse-zip %SOURCE_FILE %DESTINATION_DIR
<

2) FUSE_MOUNT2                                 *vifm-FUSE_MOUNT2*
   This format allows to use specially formatted files to perform mounting and
   is useful for mounting remotes, for example remote file systems over ftp or
   ssh.

   Format line:
       FUSE_MOUNT2|mounter %PARAM %DESTINATION_DIR [%CLEAR]

   Example |vifm-:filetype| command: >
       :filetype FUSE_MOUNT2|sshfs %PARAM %DESTINATION_DIR
<
   Example file content: >
       root@127.0.0.1:/
<

All % macros are expanded by vifm at runtime and have the following meaning:
   - %SOURCE_FILE is replaced by full path to selected file
   - %DESTINATION_DIR is replaced by full path to mount directory, which is
     created by vifm basing on the value of |vifm-'fusehome'| option.
   - %PARAM value is filled from the first line of file (whole line), though
     in the future it can be changed to whole file content
   - %CLEAR means that you want to clear screen before running mount command.

%CLEAR is an optional macro.  Other macros are not mandatory, but mount
commands likely won't work without them.

The mounted FUSE file systems will be automatically unmounted in two cases:
   - when vifm quits (with |vifm-ZZ|, |vifm-:q|, etc. or when killed by signal);
   - when you explicitly leave mount point going up to its parent directory
     (with |vifm-h|, |vifm-Enter| on "../" or ":cd ..") and other pane is not
     in the same directory or its child directories.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-view-look*

vifm supports displaying of file list view in two different ways:
   - in a table mode, when multiple columns can be set using |vifm-'viewcolumns'|
     option (see |vifm-column-view| for details);
   - in a multicolumn list manner which looks almost like `ls -x` command
     output (see |vifm-ls-view| for details).

The look is local for each view and can be chosen by changing value of the
|vifm-'lsview'| boolean option.

Depending on view look some of keys change their meaning to allow more natural
cursor moving.  This concerns mainly |vifm-h|, |vifm-j|, |vifm-k|, |vifm-l| and other
similar navigation keys.

Also some of options can be ignored if they don't affect view displaying in
selected look.  For example value of |vifm-'viewcolumns'| when |vifm-'lsview'| is
set.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-ls-view*

When this view look is enabled by setting |vifm-'lsview'| option on, vifm will
display files in multiple columns.  Number of columns depends on the length of
the longest file name present in current directory of the view.  Whole file
list is automatically reflowed on directory change, terminal or view resize.

View looks close to output of `ls -x` command, so files are listed left to
right in rows.

In this mode file manipulation commands (e.g. |vifm-d|) don't work line-wise like
they do in Vim, since such operations would be uncommon for file manipulating
tasks.  Thus, for example, |vifm-dd| will remove only current file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-column-view*

View columns are described by a comma-separated list of column descriptions,
each of which has the following format >
    [ '-' ] [ fw ( [ '.' tw ] | '%' ) ] '{' type '}' '.'{0,3}
where fw stands for full width and tw stands for text width.

So it basically consists of four parts:
 1. Optional alignment specifier
 2. Optional width specifier
 3. Mandatory column name
 4. Optional cropping specifier

Alignment specifier~

It's an optional minus sign as the first symbol of the string.

Specifies type of text alignment within a column.  Two types are supported:
 - left align >
     set viewcolumns=-{name}
<- right align (default) >
     set viewcolumns={name}
<
Width specifier~

It's a number followed by a percent sign, two numbers (second one should be
less than or equal to the first one) separated with a dot or a single number.

Specifies column width and its units. There are tree size types:
 - absolute size - column width is specified in characters >
     set viewcolumns=-100{name},20.15{ext}
<  results in two columns with lengths of 100 and 20 and a reserved space of
   five characters on the left of second column.
 - relative (percent) size - column width is specified in percents of view width >
     set viewcolumns=-80%{name},15%{ext},5%{mtime}
<  results in three columns with lengths of 80/100, 15/100 and 5/100 of view
   width.
 - auto size (default) - column width is automatically determined >
     set viewcolumns=-{name},{ext},{mtime}
<  results in three columns with length of one third of view width. There is
   no size adjustment to content, since it will slow down rendering.

Columns of different sizing types can be freely mixed in one view. Though
sometimes some of columns can be seen partly or be completely invisible if
there is not enough space to display them.

Column name~

This is just a sort key surrounded with curly braces, e.g. >
    {name},{ext},{mtime}
<
{name} and {iname} keys are the same and present both for consistency with
|vifm-'sort'| option.

Empty curly braces ({}) are replaced with the default secondary column for
primary sort key. So after the next command views will be displayed almost as
if |vifm-'viewcolumns'| is empty, but adding ellipsis for long file names: >
    set viewcolumns=-{name}..,6{}.
<
Cropping specifier~

It's from one to three dots after closing curly brace in column format.

Specifies type of text truncation if it doesn't fit in the column. Currently
tree types are supported:
 - truncation - text is truncated >
     set viewcolumns=-{name}.
<  results in truncation of names that are too long too fit in the view.
 - adding of ellipsis - ellipsis on the left or right are added when needed >
     set viewcolumns=-{name}..
<  results in that ellipsis are added at the end of too long file names.
 - none (default) - text can pass column boundaries >
     set viewcolumns=-{name}...,{ext}
<  results in that long file names can partially be written on the ext column.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-colorschemes*

The color schemes in vifm can be applied in two different ways:
   - as the default (or main) color scheme
   - as local to a panel color scheme

Both types are set using |vifm-:colorscheme| command, but of different forms:
   - :colorscheme color_scheme_name - for the default color scheme
   - :colorscheme color_scheme_name directory - for local color schemes

Look of different parts of the TUI (Text User Interface) is determined in
this way:
   - Border, TopLineSel, TopLine, CmdLine, ErrorMsg, StatusLine and WildMenu
     are always determined by the default color scheme
   - CurrLine, Selected, Directory, Link, BrokenLink, Socket, Device,
     Executable, Fifo and Win are determined by default color scheme and a set
     of local colorschemes, which can be empty

There might be a set of local color schemes because they are structured
hierarchically according to file system structure. For example, having the
following piece of file system: >

 ~
 `-- bin
    |
    `-- my
<
Two color schemes: >

 # ~/.vifm/colors/for_bin
 highlight Win cterm=none ctermfg=white ctermbg=red
 highlight CurrLine cterm=none ctermfg=red ctermbg=black

 # ~/.vifm/colors/for_bin_my
 highlight CurrLine cterm=none ctermfg=green ctermbg=black
<
And these three commands in the vifmrc file: >

 colorscheme Default
 colorscheme for_bin ~/bin
 colorscheme for_bin_my ~/bin/my
<
File list will look in the following way for each level:
   - ~/ - Default color scheme
       black background
       cursor with blue background
   - ~/bin/ - mix of Default and for_bin color schemes
       red background
       cursor with black background and red foreground
   - ~/bin/my/ - mix of Default, for_bin and for_bin_my color schemes
       red background
       cursor with black background and green foreground

*vifm-trash*

vifm has support of trash directory, which is used as temporary storage for
deleted files or files that were cut.  Using trash is controlled by the
|vifm-'trash'| option, and exact path to the trash can be set with
|vifm-'trashdir'| option.  Trash directory in vifm differs from the system-wide
one by default, because of possible incompatibilities of storing deleted files
among different file managers.  But one can set |vifm-'trashdir'| to
"~/.local/share/Trash" to use a "standard" trash directory.

There are two scenarios of using trash in vifm:

1. As a place for storing files that were cut by |vifm-d| and may be
   inserted to some other place in file system.
2. As a storage of files, that are deleted but not purged yet.

The first scenario uses deletion (|vifm-d|) operations to put files to
trash and put (|vifm-p|) operations to restore files from trash directory.
Note that such operations move files to and from trash directory,
which can be long term operations in case of different partitions or
remote drives mounted locally.

The second scenario uses deletion (|vifm-d|) operations for moving files
to trash directory and |vifm-:empty| command-line command to purge all
previously deleted files.

Deletion and put operations depend on registers, which can point to files in
trash directory.  Normally, there are no nonexistent files in registers, but
vifm doesn't keep track of modifications under trash directory, so one
shouldn't expect value of registers to be absolutely correct if trash
directory was modified not by operation that are meant for it.  But this
won't lead to any issues with operations, since they ignore nonexistent
files.

*vifm-clientserver*

vifm supports remote execution of command-line mode commands as well as remote
changing of directories.  This is possible using |vifm---remote| command-line
argument.

To execute a command remotely combine --remote argument with |vifm--c| or
|vifm--+c|.  For example: >
    vifm --remote -c 'cd /'
    vifm --remote '+cd /'
<
To change directory not using command-line mode commands one can specify paths
right after --remote argument, like this: >
    vifm --remote /
    vifm --remote ~
    vifm --remote /usr/bin /tmp
<
At the moment there is no way of specifying, which instance of vifm should
arguments be sent.  The main purpose of --remote argument is to provide
support of using vifm as a single-instance application.

*vifm-plugin*

vifm-plugin for using vifm in vim as a file selector.

Commands:

  :EditVifm   select a file or files to open in the current buffer.
  :SplitVifm  split buffer and select a file or files to open.
  :VsplitVifm vertically split buffer and select a file or files to open.
  :DiffVifm   select a file or files to compare to the current file with
              :vert diffsplit.
  :TabVifm    select a file or files to open in tabs.

Each command accepts up to two arguments: left pane directory and right pane
directory.  After arguments are checked, vifm process is spawned in a special
"file-picker" mode.  To pick files just open them either by pressing l, i or
Enter keys, or by running :edit command.  If no files are selected, file
under the cursor is opened, otherwise whole selection is passed to the plugin
and opened in vim.

The plugin have only two settings.  It's a string variable named g:vifm_term to
let user specify command to run gui terminal.  By default it's equal to
'xterm -e'.  And another string variable named g:vifm_exec, which equals "vifm"
by default and specifies path to vifm's executable.  To pass arguments to
vifm use g:vifm_exec_args, which is empty by default.

To use the plugin copy the vifm.vim file to either the system wide vim/plugin
directory or into ~/.vim/plugin.

If you would prefer not to use the plugin and it is in the system wide plugin
directory add

let loaded_vifm=1

to your ~/.vimrc file.
