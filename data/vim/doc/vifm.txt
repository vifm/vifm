*vifm-options*

General format:
vifm [OPTION]... [ LWIN_DIR [ RWIN_DIR ] ]

The vifm executable will start vifm in the current directory unless it is
given a different directory on the command line.

vifm /path/to/directory/one
or
vifm /path/to/directory/one /path/to/directory/two

                                               *vifm---select*
Paths to files are also allowed in case you want vifm to start with some
archive opened.  If you want to select file, prepend its path with --select.

The other command line arguments are:
                                               *vifm--f*
-f - only used from the vifm.vim script.  The selected files are written
    to $VIFM/vimfiles and vifm exits.

--logging                                      *vifm---logging*
    log some errors to $VIFM/log.
    Also /var/log/vifm-startup-log (on *nix) and startup-log in the directory
    of executable (on Windows) is used to log startup process (when
    configuration directory isn't determined).
--remote                                       *vifm---remote*
    passes all arguments that left in command line to active vifm server
    (already running instance if any).
-c <command>, +<command>                       *vifm--c* *vifm--+c*
    run <command> on startup.
--help, -h                                     *vifm---help* *vifm--h*
    show a brief command summary and exit vifm.
--version, -v                                  *vifm---version* *vifm--v*
    show the version information and exit.
--no-configs                                   *vifm---no-configs*

                                               *vifm-(*
( - goto previous group.  Groups are defined by primary sorting key.
    For name and iname members of each group have same first letter,
    for all other sorting keys vifm uses size, uid, ...

) - goto next group.  See ( key description above.

Using Count~
                                               *vifm-count* *vifm-[count]*
You can use count with commands like yy.

[count]yy yank (count + 1) files starting from current cursor position
downward.

Or you can use count with motions passed to y, d or D.

d[count]j delete (count + 1) files starting from current cursor position
upward.

Registers~
                                               *vifm-registers*
vifm supports multiple registers for temporary storing list of yanked or
deleted files.

Registers should be specified with hitting double quite key followed by a
register name.  Count is specified after register name.  By default
commands use unnamed register, which has double quote as its name.

Though all commands accept registers, most of commands ignores them (for
example H or Ctrl-U).  Other commands can fill register or append new
files to it.

Presently vifm supports ", _, a-z and A-Z characters as register names.

_ is black hole register.  It can be used for writing, but its list is always
empty.

As mentioned above " is unnamed register and has special meaning of the
default register.  Every time when you use named registers (a-z and A-Z)
unnamed register is updated to contain same list of files as the last
used register.

Registers with names from a to z  and from A to Z are named ones.
Lowercase registers are cleared before adding new files, while uppercase
aren't and should be used to append new files to the existing file list
of appropriate lowercase register (A for a, B for b, ...).

Registers can be changed on :empty command if they contain files under
Trash directory.

Registers do not contain one file more than once.

Example:
  "a2yy
will put names of two files to register a (and to the unnamed register).
  "Ad
will remove one file and append its name to register a (and to the
unnamed register).
  p or "ap or "Ap
will insert previously yanked and deleted files into current directory.

Selectors~
                                               *vifm-selectors*
y, d and D commands accept selectors.  You can combine them with every of
selectors below to quickly remove or yank several files.

j, k, gg, G, H, L, M, %, f, F, ;, comma and ' can be used as selectors for
several commands.
Also following selectors can be used:
 a - all files in current view
 s - selected files
 S - all files except selected

For example:
dj - delete file under cursor and one below.
d2j - delete file under cursor and two below.
y6gg - yank all files from cursor position to 6th file in the list.

*vifm-commands*

vifm-commands are executed with :command_name<Return>

'|' can be used to separate commands, so you can give multiple commands in one
line.  If you want to use '|' in an argument, precede it with '\'.

Commented out lines should start with the double quote symbol, which may be
preceded by whitespace characters.

Most of the commands have two forms: complete and the short one.
Example:
:noh[lsearch]
This means the complete command is nohlsearch, and the short one is noh.

                                               *vifm-:range*

Ranges~
                                                               *vifm-ranges*
The ranges implemented include:
  Numbers :2,3
  % - the entire directory.
  . - the current position in the filelist.
  $ - the end of the filelist.
  't - the mark position t.

  :%delete would delete all files in the directory.
  :2,4delete would delete the files in the list positions 2 through 4.
  :.,$delete would delete the files from the current position to the end
    of the filelist.
  :3delete4 would delete the files in the list positions 3, 4, 5, 6.

If a backward range is given :4,2delete - an query message is given and
user can chose what to do next.

The builtin commands that accept a range are :d[elete] and :y[ank].

Command macros~

The command macros may be used in user commands.
  %a      user arguments.
  %c %"c  the current file under the cursor.
  %C %"C  the current file under the cursor in the other directory.
  %f %"f  all of the selected files.
  %F %"F  all of the selected files in the other directory list.
  %b %"b  same as %f %F.
  %d %"d  full path to current directory.
  %D %"D  full path to other file list directory.
  %m      show command output in a menu.
  %M      same as %m, but l (or Enter) key is handled like for :locate
          and :find commands.
  %S      show command output in the status bar.
  %s      execute command in screen split.
  %i      completely ignore command output.

Use %% if you need to put a percent sign in your command.

You can use filename modifiers after %c, %C, %f, %F, %b, %d and %D macros.
Supported modifiers are:
    :p           - full path
    :u           - UNC name of path (e.g. "\\server" in "\\server\share"),
                   Windows only.  Expands to current computer name for not
                   UNC paths.
    :~           - relative to the home directory
    :.           - relative to current directory
    :h           - head of the filename
    :t           - tail of the filename
    :r           - root of the filename (without last extension)
    :e           - extension of the filename (last one)
    :s?pat?sub?  - substitute the first occurrence of "pat" with "sub".  You
                   can use any character for '?', but it must not occur in pat
                   or sub
    :gs?pat?sub? - like :s, but substitutes all occurrences of "pat" with
                   "sub".
See ':h filename-modifiers' in Vim's documentation for the detailed
description.

Using %x means expand corresponding macro escaping all characters that have
special meaning.  And %"x means using of double quotes and escape only backslash
and double quote characters, which is more useful on Windows systems.

Position and quantity (if there is any) of %m, %M, %S or %s macros in the
command is unimportant.  All their occurrences will be removed from the
resulting command.

%c and %f macros are expanded to file names only, when %C and %F are expanded
to full paths.  %f and %F follow this in %b too.

:com move mv %f %D - would set the :move command to move all of the files
selected in the current directory to the other directory.

The %a macro will substitute any arguments given in a command into the
command.  All arguments are considered optional.
:com lsl !!ls -l %a - will set the lsl command to execute ls -l with or
without an argument.

:lsl<Return> will list the directory contents of the current directory.
:lsl filename<Return> will list only the given filename.

The macros can also be used in directly executing commands.
:!mv %f %D - would move the current directory selected files to the other
directory.

Appending & to the end of a command will cause it to be executed in the
background.  Typically you want to run two kinds of external commands in the
background:
 - GUI applications that doesn't fork thus block vifm (:!sxiv %f &);
 - console tools that do not work with terminal (:!mv %f %D &).
You don't want to run terminal commands, which require terminal input or
output something because they will mess up vifm's TUI. Anyway, if you did run
such a command, you can use Ctrl-L key to update vifm's TUI.

:!mv %f %D &

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-commands-bg*

Copy and move operation can take a lot of time to proceed.  That's why vifm
supports backgrounding of this two operations.  To run :copy, :move or :delete
command in the background just add " &" at the end of a command.

For each background operation a new thread will be created.  Currently job
cannot be stopped or paused.

You can see if command is still running in the :jobs menu.  Backgrounded
commands have progress instead of process id at the line beginning.

Background operations cannot be undone.

<f0> - <f63> - functional keys
<c-f1>,...,<c-f12>                             {only for MS-Windows}
functional keys with Control key pressed.
<a-f1>,...,<a-f12>                             {only for MS-Windows}
functional keys with Alt key pressed.
<s-f1>,...,<s-f12>                             {only for MS-Windows}
functional keys with Shift key pressed.

vifm removes whitespace characters at the beginning and end of commands.
That's why you may want to use <space> at the end of rhs in mappings.  For
example: >
 cmap <f1> man<space>
will put "man " in line when you hit the <f1> key in the command line mode.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-startup*

On startup vifm determines several variables that are used during the session.
They are determined in the order they appear below.

                                               *vifm-$HOME*
On *nix systems $HOME is normally present and used as is.
On Windows systems vifm tries to find correct home directory in the following
order:
 - $HOME variable;
 - $USERPROFILE variable;
 - a combination of $HOMEDRIVE and $HOMEPATH variables.

                                               *vifm-$VIFM*
vifm tries to find correct configuration directory by checking the following
places:
 - $VIFM variable;
 - parent directory of the executable file (on Windows only);
 - $HOME/.vifm directory;
 - $APPDATA/Vifm directory (on Windows only).

                                               *vifm-$MYVIFMRC*
vifm tries to find correct configuration file by checking the following places:
 - $MYVIFMRC variable;
 - vifmrc in parent directory of the executable file (on Windows only);
 - $VIFM/vifmrc file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-configure*

See |vifm-startup| section above for the explanations on |vifm-$VIFM| and
|vifm-$MYVIFMRC|.

                                               *vifm-vifmrc*
The vifmrc file contains commands that will be executed on vifm startup.  See
|vifm-$MYVIFMRC| variable description for search algorithm used to find vifmrc.
Use it to set settings, mappings, filetypes etc.  To use multi line commands
precede each next line with a slash (whitespace before slash is ignored, but all
spaces at the end of the lines are saved).  For example:
set
    \smartcase
equals "setsmartcase".  When
set<space here>
    \ smartcase
equals "set  smartcase".

                                               *vifm-vifminfo*
The $VIFM/vifminfo file contains session settings.  You may edit it by hand
to change the settings, but it's not recommended to do that, edit vifmrc
instead.  You can control what settings will be saved in vifminfo by setting
|vifm-'vifminfo'| option.  Vifm always writes this file on exit unless
|vifm-'vifminfo'| option is empty.  Bookmarks, commands, directory history,
filetypes, fileviewers and registers in the file are merged with vifm
configuration (which has bigger priority).

                                               *vifm-scripts*
The $VIFM/scripts directory can contain shell scripts.  vifm modifies
it's PATH environment variable to let user run those scripts without specifying
full path.  All subdirectories of the $VIFM/scripts will be added to PATH too.
Script in a subdirectory overlaps script with the same name in all its parent
directories.

                                               *vifm-colors*
The $VIFM/colors directory contains color schemes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-fuse*

vifm has a builtin support of automated FUSE file system mounts.  It is
implemented using file associations mechanism.  To enable automated mounts, one
needs to use a specially formated program line in |vifm-:filetype| or
|vifm-:filextype| commands.  Currently two formats are supported:

1) FUSE_MOUNT                                  *vifm-FUSE_MOUNT*
   This format should be used in case when all information needed for mounting
   all files of a particular type is the same.  E.g. mounting of tar files
   don't require any file specific options.

   Format line:
       FUSE_MOUNT|mounter %SOURCE_FILE %DESTINATION_DIR [%CLEAR]

   Example |vifm-:filetype| command: >
       :filetype FUSE_MOUNT|fuse-zip %SOURCE_FILE %DESTINATION_DIR
<

2) FUSE_MOUNT2                                 *vifm-FUSE_MOUNT2*
   This format allows to use specially formatted files to perform mounting and
   is useful for mounting remotes, for example remote file systems over ftp or
   ssh.

   Format line:
       FUSE_MOUNT2|mounter %PARAM %DESTINATION_DIR [%CLEAR]

   Example |vifm-:filetype| command: >
       :filetype FUSE_MOUNT2|sshfs %PARAM %DESTINATION_DIR
<
   Example file content: >
       root@127.0.0.1:/
<

All % macros are expanded by vifm at runtime and have the following meaning:
   - %SOURCE_FILE is replaced by full path to selected file
   - %DESTINATION_DIR is replaced by full path to mount directory, which is
     created by vifm basing on the value of |vifm-'fusehome'| option.
   - %PARAM value is filled from the first line of file (whole line), though
     in the future it can be changed to whole file content
   - %CLEAR means that you want to clear screen before running mount command.

%CLEAR is an optional macro.  Other macros are not mandatory, but mount
commands likely wont work without them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-plugin*

vifm-plugin for using vifm in vim as a file selector.

Commands:

  :EditVifm   select a file or files to open in the current buffer.
  :SplitVifm  split buffer and select a file or files to open.
  :VsplitVifm vertically split buffer and select a file or files to open.
  :DiffVifm   select a file or files to compare to the current file with
              :vert diffsplit.
  :TabVifm    select a file or files to open in tabs.

Each command accepts up to two arguments: left pane directory and right pane
directory.

The plugin have only two settings.  It's a string variable named g:vifm_term to
let user specify command to run gui terminal.  By default it's equal to
'xterm -e'.  And another string variable named g:vifm_exec, which equals "vifm"
by default and specifies path to vifm's executable.  To pass arguments to
vifm use g:vifm_exec_args, which is empty by default.

To use the plugin copy the vifm.vim file to either the system wide vim/plugin
directory or into ~/.vim/plugin.

If you would prefer not to use the plugin and it is in the system wide plugin
directory add

let loaded_vifm=1

to your ~/.vimrc file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*vifm-reserved*

The following command names are reserved and shouldn't be used for user
commands.

  g[lobal]
  v[global]
