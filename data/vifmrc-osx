" vim: filetype=vifm :
" Sample configuration file for vifm on OSX (last updated: 9 September, 2020)
" You can edit this file by hand.
" The " character at the beginning of a line comments out the line.
" Blank lines are ignored.
" The basic format for each item is shown with an example.

" ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

" Command used to edit files in various contexts.  The default is vim.
" If you would like to use another vi clone such as Elvis or Vile
" you will need to change this setting.

set vicmd=vim
" set vicmd=elvis\ -G\ termcap
" set vicmd=vile

" This makes vifm perform file operations on its own instead of relying on
" standard utilities like `cp`.  While using `cp` and alike is a more universal
" solution, it's also much slower when processing large amounts of files and
" doesn't support progress measuring.

set syscalls

" Trash Directory
" The default is to move files that are deleted with dd or :d to
" the trash directory.  If you change this you will not be able to move
" files by deleting them and then using p to put the file in the new location.
" I recommend not changing this until you are familiar with vifm.
" This probably shouldn't be an option.

set trash

" This is how many directories to store in the directory history.

set history=100

" Automatically resolve symbolic links on l or Enter.

set nofollowlinks

" With this option turned on you can run partially entered commands with
" unambiguous beginning using :! (e.g. :!Te instead of :!Terminal or :!Te<tab>).

" set fastrun

" Natural sort of (version) numbers within text.

set sortnumbers

" Maximum number of changes that can be undone.

set undolevels=100

" Use Vim's format of help file (has highlighting and "hyperlinks").
" If you would rather use a plain text help file set novimhelp.

set vimhelp

" If you would like to run an executable file when you
" press Enter, l or Right Arrow, set this.

set norunexec

" List of color schemes to try (picks the first one supported by the terminal)

colorscheme Default-256 Default

" Format for displaying time in file list. For example:
" TIME_STAMP_FORMAT=%m/%d-%H:%M
" See man date or man strftime for details.

set timefmt=%m/%d\ %H:%M

" Show list of matches on tab completion in command-line mode

set wildmenu

" Display completions in a form of popup with descriptions of the matches

set wildstyle=popup

" Display suggestions in normal, visual and view modes for keys, marks and
" registers (at most 5 files).  In other view, when available.

set suggestoptions=normal,visual,view,otherpane,keys,marks,registers

" Ignore case in search patterns unless it contains at least one uppercase
" letter

set ignorecase
set smartcase

" Don't highlight search results automatically

set nohlsearch

" Use increment searching (search while typing)
set incsearch

" Try to leave some space from cursor to upper/lower border in lists

set scrolloff=4

" Don't do too many requests to slow file systems

set slowfs=curlftpfs

" Set custom status line look

" The following macros can be used in a command
" %a is replaced with the user arguments.
" %c the current file under the cursor.
" %C the current file under the cursor in the other directory.
" %f the current selected file, or files.
" %F the current selected file, or files in the other directory.

" The file type is for the default programs to be used with
" a file extension.
" :filetype pattern1,pattern2 defaultprogram,program2
" :fileviewer pattern1,pattern2 consoleviewer
" The other programs for the file type can be accessed with the :file command
" The command macros like %f, %F, %d, %D may be used in the commands.
" Spaces in an app name will have to be escaped e.g. QuickTime\ Player.app
" The %a macro is ignored.  To use a % you must put %%.

" For automated FUSE mounts, you must register an extension with :file[x]type
" in one of following formats:
"
" :filetype extensions FUSE_MOUNT|some_mount_command using %SOURCE_FILE and %DESTINATION_DIR variables
" %SOURCE_FILE and %DESTINATION_DIR are filled in by vifm at runtime.
" A sample line might look like this:
" :filetype *.zip,*.jar,*.war,*.ear FUSE_MOUNT|fuse-zip %SOURCE_FILE %DESTINATION_DIR
"
" :filetype extensions FUSE_MOUNT2|some_mount_command using %PARAM and %DESTINATION_DIR variables
" %PARAM and %DESTINATION_DIR are filled in by vifm at runtime.
" A sample line might look like this:
" :filetype *.ssh FUSE_MOUNT2|sshfs %PARAM %DESTINATION_DIR
" %PARAM value is filled from the first line of file (whole line).
" Example first line for SshMount filetype: root@127.0.0.1:/
"
" You can also add %CLEAR if you want to clear screen before running FUSE
" program.
