.SH NAME
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
vifm \- vi file manager
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH SYNOPSIS
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
vifm [OPTION]...
.br
vifm [OPTION]... path
.br
vifm [OPTION]... path path
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vifm is an ncurses based file manager with vi like keybindings.  If you use vi,
vifm gives you complete keyboard control over your files without having to learn
a new set of commands.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH OPTIONS
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
vifm starts in the current directory unless it is given a different directory
on the command line or 'vifminfo' option includes "savedirs" (in which case
last visited directories are used as defaults).
.TP
.BI -
Read list of files from standard input stream and compose custom view out of
them (see "Custom views" section).  Current working directory is used as a base
for relative paths.
.TP
.BI <path>
Starts Vifm in the specified path.
.TP
.BI "<path> <path>"
Starts Vifm in the specified paths.
.LP
Specifying two directories triggers split view even when vifm was in single-view
mode on finishing previous session.  To suppress this behaviour :only command
can be put in the vifmrc file.
.LP
When only one path argument is found on command-line, the left/top pane is
automatically set as the current view.
.LP
Paths to files are also allowed in case you want vifm to start with some
archive opened.
.TP
.BI "\-\-select <path>"
Open parent directory of the given path and select specified file in it.
.TP
.BI \-f
Makes vifm instead of opening files write selection to $VIFM/vimfiles and quit.
.TP
.BI "\-\-choose-files <path>|\-"
Sets output file to write selection into on exit instead of opening files.
"\-" means standard output.  Use empty value to disable it.
.TP
.BI "\-\-choose-dir <path>|\-"
Sets output file to write last visited directory into on exit.  "\-" means
standard output.  Use empty value to disable it.
.TP
.BI "\-\-delimiter <delimiter>"
Sets separator for list of file paths written out by vifm.  Empty value means
null character.  Default is new line character.
.TP
.BI "\-\-on\-choose <command>"
Sets command to be executed on selected files instead of opening them.  The
command may use any of macros described in "Command macros" section below.  The
command is executed once for whole selection.
.TP
.BI "\-\-logging"
Log some errors to $VIFM/log.
Also /var/log/vifm\-startup\-log (on *nix) and startup\-log in the directory of
executable (on Windows) is used to log startup process (when configuration
directory isn't determined).
.TP
.BI "\-\-remote"
Sends the rest of command line to the active vifm server (one of already running
instances if any).  When there is no server, quits silently.  There is no limit
on how many arguments can be processed.  One can combine \-\-remote with \-c
<command> or +<command> to execute command in already running instance of vifm.
See also "Client\-Server" section below.
.TP
.BI "\-c <command> or +<command>"
Run command-line mode <command> on startup.  Commands in such arguments are
executed in the order they appear in command line.  Commands with spaces or
special symbols must be enclosed in double or single quotes or all special
symbols should be escaped (the exact syntax strongly depends on shell).
.TP
.BI "\-\-help, \-h"
Show a brief command summary and exit vifm.
.TP
.BI "\-\-version, \-v"
Show version information and quit.
.TP
.BI \-\-no\-configs
Skip reading vifmrc and vifminfo.

.LP
See "Startup" section below for the explanations on $VIFM.

.LP
For Ctrl-W +, Ctrl-W \-, Ctrl-W < and Ctrl-W > commands count
can be given before and/or after Ctrl-W.  The resulting count
is a multiplication of those two.  So "2 Ctrl-W 2 \-" decreases
window size by 4 lines or columns.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Marks
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.TP
Marks are set the same way as they are in vi.
.LP
You can use this characters for marks [a\-z][A\-Z][0\-9].
.TP
.BI m[a\-z][A\-Z][0\-9]
set a mark for the file at the current cursor position.
.TP
.BI '[a\-z][A\-Z][0\-9]
navigate to the file set for the mark.

.LP
There are also several special marks that can't be set manually:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
\(aq (single quote) \- previously visited directory of the view, thus hitting
\(aq\(aq allows switching between two last locations
.IP \- 2
< \- the first file of the last visually selected block
.IP \- 2
> \- the last file of the last visually selected block
.RE
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Searching
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.TP
.BI "/regular expression pattern"
search for files matching regular expression in forward direction and advance
cursor to next match.
.TP
.BI "/"
perform forward search with top item of search pattern history.
.TP
.BI "?regular expression pattern"
search for files matching regular expression in backward direction and advance
cursor to previous match.
.TP
.BI "?"
perform backward search with top item of search pattern history.
.TP
Matches are automatically selected if 'hlsearch' is set.  Enabling 'incsearch' \
makes search interactive.  'ignorecase' and 'smartcase' options affect case \
sensitivity of search queries.

.TP
.BI [count]n
go to the next file matching last search pattern.  Takes last search direction
into account.
.TP
.BI [count]N
go to the previous file matching last search pattern.  Takes last search
direction into account.
.TP
If 'hlsearch' option is set, hitting n/N to perform search and go to the first \
matching item resets current selection in normal mode.  It is not the case if \
search was already performed on files in the directory, thus selection is not \
reset after clearing selection with escape key and hitting n/N key again.
.LP
Note: vifm uses extended regular expressions for / and ?.

.TP
.BI [count]f[character]
search forward for file with [character] as first character in name.  Search
wraps around the end of the list.
.TP
.BI [count]F[character]
search backward for file with [character] as first character in name.  Search
wraps around the end of the list.
.TP
.BI [count];
find the next match of f or F.
.TP
.BI [count],
find the previous match of f or F.
.LP
Note: f, F, ; and , wrap around list beginning and end when they are used
alone and they don't wrap when they are used as selectors.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH File Filters
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are three basic file filters:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
dot files filter (excluding "." and ".." special directories, which appearance
is controlled by the 'dotdirs' option);
.IP \- 2
manual filter for file names;
.IP \- 2
automatic filter for file names;
.IP \- 2
local filter for file names (see description of the "=" normal mode command).
.RE

Performing operations on manual filter for file names automatically does the
same on automatic one.  The file name filter is separated mainly for
convenience purpose and to get more deterministic behaviour.

The basic vim folding key bindings are used for filtering files.
.TP
Each file list has its own copy of each filter.
.TP
Filtered files are not checked in / search or :commands.
.TP
Files and directories are filtered separately.  For this a slash is appended \
to a directory name before testing whether it matches the filter.  Examples:

.EX
.LP
  " filter directories which names end with '.files'
  :filter /^.*\\.files\\/$/

  " filter files which names end with '.d'
  :filter /^.*\\.d$/

  " filter files and directories which names end with '.o'
  :filter /^.*\\.o\\/?$/
.EE
.TP
.BI za
toggle visibility of dot files.
.TP
.BI zo
show dot files.
.TP
.BI zm
hide dot files.
.TP
.BI zf
add selected files to file name filter.
.TP
.BI zO
show files hidden by file name filter.
.TP
.BI zM
restore all filters.
.TP
.BI zR
remove all filters.
.TP
.BI zd
exclude selection or current file from custom view.  Does nothing for regular
view.
.TP
.BI "=regular expression pattern"
filter out files that don't match regular expression.  Whether view is updated
as regular expression is changed depends on the value of the 'incsearch' option.
This kind of filter is automatically reset when directory is changed.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Other Normal Mode Keys
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

section for details.  Unlike other q{x} commands this one doesn't work in Visual
mode.
.TP
.BI "[count]!! and [count]!<selector>"
enter command line mode with entered ! command.  [count] modifies range.
.TP
.BI Ctrl-O
go backwards through directory history of current view.  Nonexistent directories
are automatically skipped.
.TP
.BI Ctrl-I
if 'cpoptions' contains "t" flag, <tab> and <c-i> switch active pane just like
<space> does, otherwise it goes forward through directory history of current
view.  Nonexistent directories are automatically skipped.

like ga, but force update.  Ignores old values of directory sizes.
.LP
If file under cursor is selected, each selected item is processed, otherwise
only current file is updated.
.TP
.BI gf
find link destination (like l with 'followlinks' off, but also finds
directories).
.TP
.BI gr
only for MS-Windows
.br
same as l key, but tries to run program with administrative privileges.
.TP
.BI av
go to visual mode into selection amending state preserving current selection.

directory if they were deleted with dd or :d[elete] or if the files were yanked
from trash directory.  See "Trash directory" section below.
.TP
.BI P
move the last yanked files.  The advantage of using P instead of d followed by
p is that P moves files only once.  This isn't important in case you're moving
files in the same file system where your home directory is, but using P to
move files on some other file system (or file systems, in case you want to move
files from fs1 to fs2 and your home is on fs3) can save your time.

.TP
.BI ZZ
same as :quit.
.TP
.BI .
repeat last command-line command (not normal mode command) of this session (does
nothing right after startup or :restart command).  The command doesn't depend on
command-line history and can be used with completely disabled history.
.TP
.BI (
goto previous group.  Groups are defined by primary sorting key.  For name and
iname members of each group have same first letter, for all other sorting keys
vifm uses size, uid, ...
.TP
.BI )
goto next group.  See ( key description above.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Using Count
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.TP
You can use count with commands like yy.
.TP
.BI [count]yy
yank count files starting from current cursor position downward.
.TP
Or you can use count with motions passed to y, d or D.
.TP
.BI d[count]j
delete (count + 1) files starting from current cursor position upward.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Registers
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.LP
vifm supports multiple registers for temporary storing list of yanked or
deleted files.

Registers should be specified by hitting double quote key followed by a
register name.  Count is specified after register name.  By default commands use
unnamed register, which has double quote as its name.

Though all commands accept registers, most of commands ignores them (for example
H or Ctrl-U).  Other commands can fill register or append new files to it.

Presently vifm supports ", _, a-z and A-Z characters as register names.

As mentioned above " is unnamed register and has special meaning of the default
register.  Every time when you use named registers (a-z and A-Z) unnamed
register is updated to contain same list of files as the last used register.

_ is black hole register.  It can be used for writing, but its list is always
empty.

Registers with names from a to z and from A to Z are named ones.  Lowercase
registers are cleared before adding new files, while uppercase aren't and should
be used to append new files to the existing file list of appropriate lowercase
register (A for a, B for b, ...).

Registers can be changed on :empty command if they contain files under trash
directory (see "Trash directory" section below).

Registers do not contain one file more than once.

Example:
.EX

  "a2yy

.EE
.br
puts names of two files to register a (and to the unnamed register),
.EX

  "Ad

.EE
.br
removes one file and append its name to register a (and to the unnamed
register),
.EX

  p or "ap or "Ap

.EE
.br
inserts previously yanked and deleted files into current directory.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Selectors
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.TP
y, d, D, !, gu and gU commands accept selectors.  You can combine them with \
any of selectors below to quickly remove or yank several files.
.LP
Most of selectors are like vi motions: j, k, gg, G, H, L, M, %, f, F, ;, \
comma, ', ^, 0 and $.  But there are some additional ones.
.TP
.BI a
all files in current view.
.TP
.BI s
selected files.
.TP
.BI S
all files except selected.
.LP
Examples:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
dj \- delete file under cursor and one below;
.IP \- 2
d2j \- delete file under cursor and two below;
.IP \- 2
y6gg \- yank all files from cursor position to 6th file in the list.
.RE

When you pass a count to whole command and its selector they are multiplied. So:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
2d2j \- delete file under cursor and four below;
.IP \- 2
2dj \- delete file under cursor and two below;
.IP \- 2
2y6gg \- yank all files from cursor position to 12th file in the list.
.RE
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Visual Mode
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Visual mode has to generic operating submodes:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
plain selection as it is in Vim;
.IP \- 2
selection editing submode.
.RE

Both modes select files in range from cursor position at which visual mode was
entered to current cursor position (let's call it "selection region").  Each of
two borders can be adjusted by swapping them via "o" or "O" keys and updating
cursor position with regular cursor motion keys.  Obviously, once initial cursor
position is altered this way, real start position becomes unavailable.

Plain Vim-like visual mode starts with cleared selection, which is not restored
on rejecting selection ("Escape", "Ctrl-C", "v", "V").  Contrary to it,
selection editing doesn't clear previously selected files and restores them
after reject.  Accepting selection by performing an operation on selected
items (e.g. yanking them via "y") moves cursor to the top of current selection
region (not to the top most selected file of the view).

In turn, selection editing supports three types of editing (look at statusbar
to know which one is currently active):
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
append \- amend selection by selecting elements in selection region;
.IP \- 2
remove \- amend selection by deselecting elements in selection region;
.IP \- 2
invert \- amend selection by inverting selection of elements in selection \
region.
.RE

No matter how you activate selection editing it starts in "append".  One can
switch type of operation (in the order given above) via "Ctrl-G" key.

Almost all normal mode keys work in visual mode, but instead of accepting
selectors they operate on selected items.
.TP
.BI Enter
save selection and go back to normal mode not moving cursor.
.TP
.BI av
leave visual mode if in amending mode (restores previous selection), otherwise
switch to amending selection mode.
.TP
.BI gv
restore previous visual selection.
.TP
.BI "v, V, Ctrl-C or Escape"
leave visual mode if not in amending mode, otherwise switch to normal visual
selection.
.TP
.BI Ctrl-G
switch type of amending by round robin scheme: append \-> remove \-> invert.
.TP
.BI :
enter command line mode.  Selection is cleared on leaving the mode.
.TP
.BI o
switch active selection bound.
.TP
.BI O
switch active selection bound.
.TP
.BI "gu, u"
make names of selected files lowercase.
.TP
.BI "gU, U"
make names of selected files uppercase.

.TP
.BI "r, Ctrl-R, Ctrl-L"
repaint screen.
.TP
.BI R
reload view preserving scroll position.
.TP
.BI F
toggle automatic forwarding.  Roughly equivalent to periodic file reload and
scrolling to the bottom.  The behaviour is similar to `tail \-F` or F key in
less.
.TP
.BI [count]/pattern
search forward for ([count]\(hyth) matching line.

is taken from the 'vicmd'/'vixcmd' option value and extended with middle line
number prepended by a plus sign and name of the current file.
.LP
All "Ctrl-W x" keys work the same was as in Normal mode.  Active mode is
automatically changed on navigating among windows.  When less-like mode
activated on file preview is left using one by "Ctrl-W x" keys, its state is
stored until another file is displayed using preview (it's possible to leave the
mode, hide preview pane, do something else, then get back to the file and show

.SH Command line editing
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
vifm provides a facility to edit several kinds of data, that is usually edited
in command-line mode, in external editor (using command specified by
\(aqvicmd\(aq or 'vixcmd' option).  This has at least two advantages
over built-in command-line mode:
  \- one can use full power of Vim to edit text;
  \- finding and reusing history entries becomes possible.

The facility is supported by four input submodes of the command-line:
  \- command;
  \- forward search;
  \- backward search;
  \- file rename (see description of cw and cW normal mode keys).

Editing command-line using external editor is activated by the Ctrl-G
shortcut.  It's also possible to do almost the same from Normal and Visual
modes using q:, q/ and q? commands.

Temporary file created for the purpose of editing the line has the following
structure:
.RS 2
.IP 1. 3
First line, which is either empty or contains text already entered in
command-line.
.IP 2. 3
2nd and all other lines with history items starting with the most recent one.
Altering this lines in any way won't change history items stored by vifm.
.RE

After editing application is finished the first line of the file is taken as
the result of operation, when the application returns zero exit code.  If the
application returns an error (see :cquit command in Vim), all the edits made to
the file are ignored, but the initial value of the first line is saved in
appropriate history.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Commands
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Commands are executed with :command_name<Enter>

Commented out lines should start with the double quote symbol, which may be
preceded by whitespace characters.

Most of the commands have two forms: complete and the short one.
Example:
.EX

  :noh[lsearch]

.EE
This means the complete command is nohlsearch, and the short one is noh.

Most of command-line commands completely reset selection in the current view.
However, there are several exceptions:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
":invert s" most likely leaves some files selected;
.IP \- 2
:if and :else commands doesn't affect selection on successful execution.
.RE

\(aq|\(aq can be used to separate commands, so you can give multiple commands in one
line.  If you want to use '|' in an argument, precede it with '\\'.

These commands see '|' as part of their arguments even when it's escaped:

    :[range]!
    :cmap
    :cnoremap
    :command
    :filetype
    :fileviewer
    :filextype
    :map
    :mmap
    :mnoremap
    :nmap
    :nnoremap
    :noremap
    :normal
    :qmap
    :qnoremap
    :vmap
    :vnoremap
    :wincmd
    :windo
    :winrun

To be able to use another command after one of these, wrap it with the :execute
command.  An example:
.EX

  if filetype('.') == 'reg' | execute '!!echo regular file' | endif
.EE
.TP
.BI :[count]
.TP
.BI :number

associate given program list to each of the patterns.  Associated
program (command) is used by handlers of l and Enter keys (and also in
the :file menu).  If you need to insert comma into command just double it
(",,").  Space followed by an ampersand as two last characters of a command
means running of the command in the background.  Optional description can be
given to each command to ease understanding of what command will do in the
:file menu.  Vifm will try the rest of the programs for an association when
the default isn't found.  When program entry doesn't contain any of vifm
macros, name of current file is appended as if program entry ended with %c
macro on *nix and %"c on Windows.  On Windows path to executables containing
spaces can (and should be for correct work with such paths) be double quoted.
See "Patterns" section below for pattern definition.  See also
"Automatic FUSE mounts" section below.  Example for zip archives and several
actions:

.EX
  filetype *.zip,*.jar,*.war,*.ear
         \\ {Mount with fuse-zip}
         \\ FUSE_MOUNT|fuse-zip %SOURCE_FILE %DESTINATION_DIR,
         \\ {View contents}
         \\ zip \-sf %c | less,
         \\ {Extract here}
         \\ tar \-xf %c,
.EE
.TP
.BI ":filet[ype] filename"
list (in menu mode) currently registered patterns that match specified file
name.  Same as ":filextype filename".
.TP
.BI "                                         :filextype"
.TP
.BI ":filex[type] pat1,pat2,... [{ description }] def_program,program2,..."
same as :filetype, but this command is ignored if not running in X.
In X :filextype is equal to :filetype.  See "Patterns" section below for pattern
definition.  See also "Automatic FUSE mounts" section below.

For example, consider the following settings (the order might seem strange,
but it's for the demonstration purpose):

.EX
  filetype *.html,*.htm
          \\ {View in lynx}
          \\ lynx
  filextype *.html,*.htm
          \\ {Open with dwb}
          \\ dwb %f %i &,
  filetype *.html,*.htm
          \\ {View in links}
          \\ links
  filextype *.html,*.htm
          \\ {Open with firefox}
          \\ firefox %f &,
          \\ {Open with uzbl}
          \\ uzbl-browser %f %i &,
.EE

If you're using vifm inside a terminal emulator that is running in graphical
environment (when X is used on *nix; always on Windows), vifm attempts to run
application in this order:

1. lynx
.br
2. dwb
.br
3. links
.br
4. firefox
.br
5. uzbl

If there is no graphical environment (checked presence of $DISPLAY
environment variable on *nix; never happens on Windows), the list will look
like:

1. lynx
.br
2. links

Just as if all :filextype commands were not there.

The purpose of such differentiation is to allow comfortable use of vifm
with same settings in desktop environment/through remote connection (SSH)/\
in native console.
.TP
.BI ":filext[ype] filename"
list (in menu mode) currently registered patterns that match specified file
name.  Same as ":filetype filename".
.TP
.BI "                                         :fileviewer"
.TP
.BI ":filev[iewer] pat1,pat2,... command1,command2,..."
register specified list of commands as viewers for each of the patterns.  Viewer
is a command which output is captured and displayed in the second pane of vifm
after running :view command.  When the command doesn't contain any of vifm
macros, name of current file is appended as if command ended with %c macro.
Comma escaping and missing commands processing rules as for :filetype apply to
this command.  See "Patterns" section below for pattern definition.

Example for zip archives:

  fileviewer *.zip,*.jar,*.war,*.ear zip \-sf %c, echo "No zip to preview:"
.EE
.TP
.BI ":filev[iewer] filename"
list (in menu mode) currently registered patterns that match specified filename.
.TP
.BI "                                         :filter"
.TP
.BI ":filter[!] regular_expression_pattern"
.TP
.BI ":filter[!] /regular_expression_pattern/[flags]"
will filter all the files out of the directory listing that match the regular
expression.  Using second variant you can use the bar ('|') symbol without
escaping.  Empty regular expression (specified by //, "" or '') means using of
the last search pattern.  Use '!' to control state of filter inversion after
updating filter value (also see 'cpoptions' description).  Filter is matched
case sensitively on *nix and case insensitively on Windows.

Supported flags:
  \- "i" makes filter case insensitive;
  \- "I" makes filter case sensitive.

Flags might be repeated multiple times, later ones win (e.g. "iiiI" is
equivalent to "I" and "IiIi" is the same as "i").

.EX
" filter all files ending in .o from the filelist.
:filter /\.o$/
.EE

Note: vifm uses extended regular expressions.
.TP
.BI ":filter"
reset filter (set it to empty string) and show all files.

.BI :filter?
show information on local, name and auto filters.
.TP
.BI "                                         :find"
.TP
.BI ":[range]fin[d] pattern"
display results of find command in the menu.  Searches among selected files if
any.  Accepts macros.  By default the command relies on the external "find"
utility, which can be customized by altering value of the 'findprg' option.
.TP
.BI ":[range]fin[d] \-opt..."
same as :find above, but user defines all find arguments.  Searches among
selected files if any.
.TP
.BI ":[range]fin[d] path \-opt..."
same as :find above, but user defines all find arguments.  Ignores selection and
range.
.TP
.BI :[range]fin[d]
repeat last :find command.
.TP
.BI "                                         :finish"
.TP
.BI :fini[sh]
stop sourcing a script. Can only be used in a vifm script file. This is a quick
way to skip the rest of the file.
.TP
.BI "                                         :grep"
.TP
.BI ":[range]gr[ep][!] pattern"
will show results of grep command in the menu.  Add "!" to request inversion of
search (look for lines that do not match pattern).  Searches among selected
files if any and no range given.  Ignores binary files by default.  By default
the command relies on the external "grep" utility, which can be customized by
altering value of the 'grepprg' option.
.TP
.BI ":[range]gr[ep][!] \-opt..."
same as :grep above, but user defines all grep arguments, which are not escaped.
Searches among selected files if any.
.TP
.BI :[range]gr[ep][!]
repeats last :grep command.  "!" of this command inverts "!" in repeated
command.
.TP
.BI "                                         :help"
.TP
.BI :h[elp]
show the help file.
.TP
.BI ":h[elp] argument"
is the same as using ':h argument' in vim.  Use vifm\-<something> to get help
on vifm (tab completion works).  This form of the command doesn't work when
\(aqvimhelp\(aq option is off.
.TP
.BI "                                         :highlight"
.TP
.BI :hi[ghlight]
will show information about all highlight groups in the current directory.
.TP
.BI ":hi[ghlight] clear"
will reset all highlighting to builtin defaults.
.TP
.BI ":hi[ghlight] ( group\-name | {pat1,pat2,...} | /regexp/ )"
will show information on given highlight group or file name pattern of color
scheme used in the active view.
.TP
.BI ":hi[ghlight] ( group\-name | {pat1,pat2,...} | /regexp/[iI] ) cterm=style | ctermfg=color | ctermbg=color"
sets style (cterm), foreground (ctermfg) or/and background (ctermbg) parameters
of highlight group or file name pattern for color scheme used in the active
view.
.LP
All style values as well as color names are case insensitive.
.LP
Available style values (some of them can be combined):
 \- bold
 \- underline
 \- reverse or inverse
 \- standout
 \- none

Available group-name values:
 \- Win \- color of all windows (views, dialogs, menus) and default color for \
their content (e.g. regular files in views)
 \- Border \- color of vertical parts of the border
 \- TopLineSel \- top line color of the current pane
 \- TopLine \- top line color of the other pane
 \- CmdLine \- the command line/status bar color
 \- ErrorMsg \- color of error messages in the status bar
 \- StatusLine \- color of the line above the status bar
 \- JobLine \- color of job line that appears above the status line
 \- WildMenu \- color of the wild menu items
 \- CurrLine \- line at cursor position in active view
 \- OtherLine \- line at cursor position in inactive view
 \- Selected \- color of selected files
 \- Directory \- color of directories
 \- Link \- color of symbolic links in the views
 \- BrokenLink \- color of broken symbolic links
 \- Socket \- color of sockets
 \- Device \- color of block and character devices
 \- Executable \- color of executable files
 \- Fifo \- color of fifo pipes

Available colors:
 \- \-1 or default or none \- default or transparent
 \- black   and lightblack
 \- red     and lightred
 \- green   and lightgreen
 \- yellow  and lightyellow
 \- blue    and lightblue
 \- magenta and lightmagenta
 \- cyan    and lightcyan
 \- white   and lightwhite
 \- 0-255 \- corresponding colors from 256-color palette

Light versions of colors are regular colors with bold attribute set.  So order
of arguments of :highlight command is important and it's better to put "cterm"
in front of others to prevent it from overwriting attributes set by "ctermfg" or
"ctermbg" arguments.

For convenience of color scheme authors xterm-like names for 256 color palette
is also supported.  The mapping is taken from
http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Xterm256_color_names_for_console_Vim

There are two colors (foreground and background) and only one bold attribute.
Thus single bold attribute affects both colors when "reverse" attribute is used
in vifm run inside terminal emulator.  At the same time linux native console can
handle boldness of foreground and background colors independently, but for
consistency with terminal emulators this is available only implicitly by using
light versions of colors.  This behaviour might be changed in the future.

Although vifm supports 256 colors in a sense they are supported by UI drawing
library, whether you will be able to use all of them highly depends on your
terminal.  To set up terminal properly, make sure that $TERM in the
environment you run vifm is set to name of 256-color terminal (on *nixes it can
also be set via X resources), e.g. xterm-256color.  One can find list of
available terminal names by listing /usr/lib/terminfo/.  Number of colors
supported by terminal with current settings can be checked via "tput colors"
command.

Here is the hierarchy of highlight groups, which you need to know for using
transparency:
  JobLine
  StatusLine
    WildMenu
  Border
  CmdLine
    ErrorMsg
  Win
    File name specific highlights
      Directory
      Link
      BrokenLink
      Socket
      Device
      Fifo
      Executable
        Selected
          CurrLine
          OtherLine
  TopLine
    TopLineSel

"none" means default terminal color for highlight groups at the first level of
the hierarchy and transparency for all others.

Here file name specific highlights mean those configured via globs ({}) or
regular expressions (//).  At most one of them is applied per file entry, namely
the first that matches file name, hence order of :highlight commands might be
important in certain cases.

.BI ":locate filename"
use "locate" command to create a menu of filenames.
Selecting a file from the menu will reload the current file list in vifm
to show the selected file.  By default the command relies on the external

multiplexer with appropriate support turned on will cause vifm to open a new
terminal multiplexer window for each new file edited or program launched from
vifm.

Same as %m, but l (or Enter) key is handled like for :locate and :find commands.
.TP
.BI %u

Use %% if you need to put a percent sign in your command.

Note that %m, %M, %s, %S, %i, %u and %U macros are mutually exclusive.  Only
the last one of them on the command will take effect.

Supported modifiers are:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2

.IP \- 2
:~           \- relative to the home directory
.IP \- 2

.IP \- 2
:gs?pat?sub? \- like :s, but substitutes all occurrences of pat with sub.

See ':h filename\-modifiers' in Vim's documentation for the detailed
description.

Using %x means expand corresponding macro escaping all characters that have
special meaning.  And %"x means using of double quotes and escape only backslash
and double quote characters, which is more useful on Windows systems.

Position and quantity (if there is any) of %m, %M, %S or %s macros in the
command is unimportant.  All their occurrences are removed from the resulting
command.

%c and %f macros are expanded to file names only, when %C and %F are expanded
to full paths.  %f and %F follow this in %b too.
.TP
.BI ":com move mv %f %D"
set the :move command to move all of the files selected in the current directory

The %a macro is replaced with any arguments given to an alias command.  All \

:com lsl !!ls \-l %a \- set the lsl command to execute ls \-l with or without an
argument.
.TP
.BI ":lsl<Enter>"
will list the directory contents of the current directory.
.TP
.BI ":lsl filename<Enter>"
will list only the given filename.

The macros can also be used in directly executing commands.  ":!mv %f %D" \
would move the current directory selected files to the other directory.

Appending & to the end of a command causes it to be executed in the \
background.  Typically you want to run two kinds of external commands in the \
background:
.RS 2

console tools that do not work with terminal (:!mv %f %D &).

You don't want to run terminal commands, which require terminal input or \
output something in background because they will mess up vifm's TUI.  Anyway, \
if you did run such a command, you can use Ctrl-L key to update vifm's TUI.

Rewriting the example command with macros given above with backgrounding:
.EX
.EE

%m, %M, %s, %S, %u and %U macros cannot be combined with background mark (" &")
as it doesn't make much sense.

.SH Command backgrounding
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Copy and move operation can take a lot of time to proceed.  That's why vifm
supports backgrounding of this two operations.  To run :copy, :move or :delete
command in the background just add " &" at the end of a command.

For each background operation a new thread is created.  Currently job cannot be

You can see if command is still running in the :jobs menu.  Backgrounded
commands have progress instead of process id at the line beginning.

Background operations cannot be undone.

.SH Cancellation
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note that cancellation works somewhat different on Windows platform due to
different mechanism of break signal propagation.  One also might need to use
Ctrl-Break shortcut instead of Ctrl-C.

There are two types of operations that can be cancelled:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
file system operations;
.IP \- 2
mounting with FUSE (but not unmounting as it can cause loss of data);
.IP \- 2
calls of external applications.
.RE

Note that vifm never terminates applications, it sends SIGINT signal and lets
the application quit normally.

When one of set of operations is cancelled (e.g. copying of 5th file of 10
files), further operations are cancelled too.  In this case undo history will
contain only actually performed operations.

Cancelled operations are indicated by "(cancelled)" suffix appended to
information message on statusbar.

.B File system operations

Currently the following commands can be cancelled: :alink, :chmod, :chown,
:clone, :copy, :delete, :mkdir, :move, :restore, :rlink, :touch.  File
putting (on p/P key) can be cancelled as well.  It's not hard to see that these
are mainly long-running operations.

Cancelling commands when they are repeated for undo/redo operations is allowed
for convenience, but is not recommended as further undo/redo operations might
get blocked by side-effects of partially cancelled group of operations.

These commands can't be cancelled: :empty, :rename, :substitute, :tr.

.B Mounting with FUSE

It's not considered to be an error, so only notification on the status bar is
shown.

.B External application calls

Each of this operations can be cancelled: :apropos, :find, :grep, :locate.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Patterns
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
:highlight, :filetype, :filextype and :fileviewer commands support both globs
and regular expressions as patterns to match file names or full paths.

There are five possible ways to write them:
.RS 2
.IP 1. 3
{comma-seperated-name-globs}
.IP 2. 3
{{comma-seperated-path-globs}}
.IP 3. 3
/name-regular-expression/[iI]
.IP 4. 3
//path-regular-expression//[iI]
.IP 5. 3
undecorated-pattern
.RE

The last form is implicitly refers to one of others.  :highlight does not accept
undecorated form, while :filetype, :filextype and :fileviewer treat it as list
of name globals.

Regular expression patterns are case insensitive by default.

"Globs" section below provides short overview of globs and some important points
that one needs to know about them.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Globs
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Globs are always case insensitive as it makes sense in general case.

*, ?, [ and ] are treated as special symbols in the pattern.  E.g.
.EX

  :filetype * less %c

.EE
matches all files.  One can use character classes for escaping, so
.EX

  :filetype [*] less %c

.EE
matches only one file name, the one which contains only asterisk symbol.

* means any number of any characters (possibly an empty substring), with one
exception: asterisk at the pattern beginning doesn't match dot in the first
position.  E.g.
.EX

  :fileviewer *.zip,*.jar zip \-sf %c

.EE
associates using of zip program to preview all files with zip or jar
extensions as listing of their content.

? means any character at this position.  E.g.
.EX

  :fileviewer ?.out file %c

.EE
calls file tool for all files which has exactly one character before their
extension (e.g. a.out, b.out).

Square brackets designate character class, which means that whole character
class matches against any of characters listed in it.  For example
.EX

  :fileviewer *.[ch] highlight \-O xterm256 \-s dante \-\-syntax c %c

.EE
makes vifm call highlight program to colorize source and header files in C
language for a 256-color terminal.  Equal command would be
.EX

  :fileviewer *.c,*.h highlight \-O xterm256 \-s dante \-\-syntax c %c

.EE

Inside square brackets ^ or ! can be used for symbol class negotiation and
the \- symbol to set a range. ^ and ! should appear right after the opening
square bracket.  For example
.EX

  :filetype *.[!d]/ inspect_dir

.EE
associates inspect_dir as additional handler for all directories that have one
character extension unless it's "d" letter.  And
.EX

  :filetype [0-9].jpg sxiv

.EE
associates sxiv picture viewer only for JPEG-files that contain single digit
in their name.

.SH :set options
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.TP
.BI "Local options"
These are kind of options that are local to a specific view. So you can set
ascending sorting order for left pane and descending order for right pane.
.TP
.BI 'aproposprg'
type: string
.br
default: "apropos %a"
.br
Specifies format for an external command to be invoked by the :apropos command.
The format supports expanding of macros, specific for a particular *prg option,
and %% sequence for inserting percent sign literally.  This option should
include the %a macro to specify placement of arguments passed to the :apropos
command.  If the macro is not used, it will be implicitly added after a space to
the value of this option.
.TP
.BI 'autochpos'
type: boolean
.br
default: true
.br
When disabled vifm will set cursor to the first line in the view after :cd and
:pushd commands instead of saved cursor position.  Disabling this will also
make vifm clear information about cursor position in the view history on :cd
and :pushd commands (and on startup if 'autochpos' is disabled in the vifmrc).
l key in the ":history ." and ":trashes" menus is treated like :cd command.
This option also affects bookmarks so that navigating to a bookmark doesn't
restore cursor position.
.TP
.BI "'columns' 'co'"
type: integer
.br
default: terminal width on startup
.br
Terminal width in characters.
.TP
.BI "'cdpath' 'cd'"
type: string list
.br
default: value of $CDPATH with commas instead of colons
.br
Specifies locations to check on changing directory with relative path that
doesn't start with "./" or "../".  When non-empty, current directory is
examined after directories listed in the option.

This option doesn't affect completion of :cd command.

Example:
.EX

  set cdpath=~

.EE
This way ":cd bin" will switch to "~/bin" even if directory named "bin" exists
in current directory, while ":cd ./bin" command will ignore value of 'cdpath'.
.TP
.BI 'chaselinks'
type: boolean
.br
default: false
.br
When enabled path of view is always resolved to real path (with all symbolic
links expanded).
.TP
.BI 'classify'
type: string list
.br
default: ":dir:/"
.br
Specifies file name prefixes and suffixes depending on file types.  The format
is: [{prefix}]:{filetype}:[{suffix}].  Either {prefix} or {suffix} or both of
them can be omitted (which is the default for all unspecified file types),
this means empty {prefix} and/or {suffix}.  {prefix} and {suffix} should
consist exactly of one character. Elements are separated by commas.  Neither
prefixes nor suffixes are part of file names, so they don't affect commands
which operate on file names in any way. Comma (',') character should not be
used.  List of file type names can be found in the description of filetype()
function.
.TP
.BI "'confirm' 'cf'"
type: boolean
.br
default: true
.br
Ask about permanent deletion of files (on D or :delete! command or on undo/redo
operation).
.TP
.BI "'cpoptions' 'cpo'"
type: charset
.br
default: "fst"
.br
Contains a sequence of single-character flags.  Each flag enables behaviour of
older versions of vifm.  Flags:
.br
f \- when included, running :filter command results in not inverted (matching
files are filtered out) and :filter! in inverted (matching files are left)
filter, when omitted, meaning of the exclamation mark changes to the opposite;
.br
s \- when included, yy, dd and DD normal mode commands act on selection, \
otherwise they operate on current file only;
.br
t \- when included, <tab> (thus <c-i>) behave as <space> and switch active \
pane, otherwise <tab> and <c-i> go forward in the view history.
.TP
.BI 'dotdirs'
type: set
.br
default: nonrootparent
.br
Controls displaying of dot directories.  The following values are possible:
 \- rootparent    \- show "../" in root directory of file system
 \- nonrootparent \- show "../" in non-root directories of file system
.br
Note that empty directories always contain "../" entry regardless of value of
this option.  "../" disappears at the moment at least one file is created.
.TP
.BI 'fastrun'
type: boolean
.br
default: false
.br
With this option turned on you can run partially entered commands with
unambiguous beginning using :! (e.g. :!Te instead of :!Terminal or :!Te<tab>).
.TP
.BI "'fillchars' 'fcs'"
type: string list
.br
default: ""
.br
Sets characters used to fill borders.
  item       default  Used for
  vborder:c  ' '      left, middle and right vertical borders

If value is omitted, its default value is used.  Example:
.EX

  set fillchars=vborder:.
.EE
.TP
.BI 'findprg'
type: string
.br
default: "find %s %a \-print , \-type d \\( ! \-readable \-o ! \-executable \\) \-prune"
.br
Specifies format for an external command to be invoked by the :find
command.  The format supports expanding of macros, specific for a particular
*prg option, and %% sequence for inserting percent sign literally.  This
option should include the %s macro to specify placement of list of paths to
search in and %a or %A macro to specify placement of arguments passed to the
:find command.  If some of the macros are not used, they will be
implicitly added after a space to the value of the option in the following
order: %s, %a.  Note that when neither %a nor %A are specified, it's %a which
is added implicitly.

The macros can slightly change their meaning depending on :find command
arguments.  When the first argument points to an existing directory, %s is
assigned all arguments and %a/%A are left empty.  Otherwise, %s is assigned
a dot (".") meaning current directory or list of selected file names, if any.
%a/%A are assigned arguments when first argument starts with a dash ("\-"),
otherwise %a gets an escaped version of arguments, prepended by "\-name"
(on *nix) or "\-iname" (on Windows) predicate.

%a and %A macros contain almost the same value, the difference is that %a can
be escaped and %A is never escaped.  %A is to be used mainly on Windows, where
shell escaping is a mess and can break command execution.

Starting from Windows Server 2003 a where command is available, one can
configure vifm to use it in the following way:
.EX

  set findprg="where /R %s %A"

.EE
As the syntax of this command is rather limited, one can't use :find
command with selection of more than one item in this case.  The command looks
for files only completely ignoring directories.

When using find port on Windows, another option is to setup 'findprg' like
this:
.EX

  set findprg="find %s %a"
.EE
.TP
.BI 'followlinks'
type: boolean
.br
default: true
.br
Follow links on l or Enter.
.TP
.BI 'fusehome'
type: string
.br
default: "($TMPDIR | $TEMP | $TEMPDIR | $TMP)/vifm_FUSE/"
.br
Directory to be used as a root dir for FUSE mounts.  Value of the option can
contain environment variables (in form "$envname"), which will be expanded
(prepend it with a slash to prevent expansion).  The value should expand to an
absolute path.

If you change this option, vifm won't remount anything.  It affects future
mounts only.  See "Automatic FUSE mounts" section below for more information.
.TP
.BI "'gdefault' 'gd'"
type: boolean
.br
default: false
.br
When on, 'g' flag is on for :substitute by default.
.TP
.BI 'grepprg'
type: string
.br
default: "grep \-n \-H \-I \-r %i %a %s"
.br
Specifies format for an external command to be invoked by the :grep command.
The format supports expanding of macros, specific for a particular *prg option,
and %% sequence for inserting percent sign literally.  This option should
include the %i macro to specify placement of "\-v" string when inversion of
results is requested, %a or %A macro to specify placement of arguments passed to
the :grep command and the %s macro to specify placement of list of files to
search in.  If some of the macros are not used, they will be implicitly added
after a space to the value of the 'grepprg' option in the following order: %i,
%a, %s.  Note that when neither %a nor %A are specified, it's %a which is added
implicitly.

See 'findprg' option for description of difference between %a and %A.

Example of setup to use ack (http://beyondgrep.com/) instead of grep:
.EX

  set grepprg=ack\\ \-H\\ \-r\\ %i\\ %a\\ %s

.BI "'rulerformat' 'ruf'"
type: string
.br
default: "%l/%S "
.br
Determines the content of the ruler.  Its minimal width is 13 characters and
it's right aligned.  Following macros are supported:
.br
 %= \- separation point between left and right aligned halves of the line
.br
 %l \- file number

 %[ \- designates beginning of an optional block
.br
 %] \- designates end of an optional block
.br

Percent sign can be followed by optional minimum field width.  Add '\-' before
minimum field width if you want field to be right aligned.  Note ambiguity with
number of filtered out files, which can be resolved with the help of width
field ("%0-").

.TP
.BI "'shortmess' 'shm'"
type: charset
.br
default: "p"
.br
Contains a sequence of single-character flags.  Each flag enables shortening
of some message displayed by vifm in the TUI.  Flags:
.br
T \- truncate status-bar messages in the middle if they are too long to fit on \
the command line.  "..." will appear in the middle.
.br
p \- use tilde shortening in view titles.
.TP
.BI 'slowfs'
type: string list
.br
default: ""
.br
only for *nix
.br
A list of mounter fs name beginnings (first column in /etc/mtab or
/proc/mounts) or paths prefixes for fs/directories that work too slow for
you.  This option can be used to stop vifm from making some requests to
particular kinds of file systems that can slow down file browsing.
Currently this means don't check if directory has changed, skip check if
target of symbolic links exists, assume that link target located on slow fs
to be a directory (allows entering directories and navigating to files via gf).
If you set the option to "*", it means all the systems are considered slow
(usefull for cygwin, where all the checks might render vifm very slow if there
are network mounts).

Example for autofs root /mnt/autofs:
.EX

  set slowfs+=/mnt/autofs
.EE
.TP
.BI "'smartcase' 'scs'"

affect file filtering.
.TP
.BI 'sort'
type: string list
.br
default: +name on *nix and +iname on Windows
.br
type: local
.br
Sets list of sorting keys (first item is primary key, second is secondary key,
etc.):
   [+\-]ext     \- extension
   [+\-]fileext \- extension (ignore folders)
   [+\-]name    \- name (including extension)
   [+\-]iname   \- name (including extension, ignores case)
   [+\-]type    \- file type (dir/reg/exe/link/char/block/sock/fifo)
   [+\-]dir     \- directory grouping (directory < file)
   [+\-]gid     \- group id (*nix only)
   [+\-]gname   \- group name (*nix only)
   [+\-]mode    \- file type derived from its mode (*nix only)
   [+\-]perms   \- permissions string (*nix only)
   [+\-]uid     \- owner id (*nix only)
   [+\-]uname   \- owner name (*nix only)
   [+\-]size    \- size
   [+\-]atime   \- time accessed (e.g. read, executed)
   [+\-]ctime   \- time changed (changes in metadata, e.g. mode)
   [+\-]mtime   \- time modified (when file contents is changed)

Note: look for st_atime, st_ctime and st_mtime in "man 2 stat" for more
information on time keys.

\(aq+\(aq means ascending sort for this key, and '\-' means descending sort.

In case "name" ("iname" on Windows) is skipped, it will be added at the end
automatically.

Value of the option is checked to include default sorting key (name on *nix,
iname on Windows).  When it is absent, the key is appended to the value of the
option.

Type key is somewhat similar in this regard but it's added implicitly:
when "type" is not specified, sorting behaves as if it was the first key in
the list.  That's why if one wants sorting algorithm to mix directories and
files, "type" should be appended to sorting option, for example like this:
.EX

  set sort+=type

.EE
or
.EX

  set sort=-size,type
.EE

Value of the option is checked to include type key and default sorting
key (name on *nix, iname on Windows).  Here is what happens if one of them is
missing:
.RS
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
type key is added at the beginning;
.IP \- 2

.RS
.IP \- 2
%t \- file name (considering value of the 'classify' option)
.IP \- 2
%A \- file attributes (permissions on *nix or properties on Windows)
%u \- user name or uid (if it cannot be resolved)
.IP \- 2
%g \- group name or gid (if it cannot be resolved)
.IP \- 2
%s \- file size in human readable format
.IP \- 2
%E \- size of selected files in human readable format, same as %s when no
files are selected, except that it will never show size of ../ in visual mode,
since it cannot be selected
.IP \- 2
%d \- file modification date (uses 'timefmt' option)
.IP \- 2
all 'rulerformat' macros

default: "%r/.vifm-Trash,$VIFM/Trash" or if $VIFM/Trash doesn't exist
         "%r/.vifm-Trash,$XDG_DATA_HOME/vifm/Trash"
.br
List of trash directory path specifications, separated with commas.
Each list item either defines an absolute path to trash directory or a path
relative to a mount point root when list element starts with "%r/".
Value of the option can contain environment variables (of form "$envname"),
which will be expanded (prepend $ with a slash to prevent expansion).
Environment variables are expanded when the option is set.

When new file gets cut (deleted) vifm traverses each element of the option in
the order of their appearance and uses first trash directory that it was able
to create or that is already writable.

Default value tries to use trash directory per mount point and falls back to
~/.vifm/Trash on failure.

Controls whether possible matches of completion will be shown above the command
line.
.TP
.BI 'wordchars'
type: string list
.br
default: "1-8,14-31,33-255" (that is all non-whitespace characters)
.br
Specifies which characters in command-line mode should be considered as part
of a word.  Value of the option is comma-separated list of ranges.  If both
endpoints of a range match, single endpoint is enough (e.g. "a" = "a-a").
Both endpoints are inclusive.  There are two accepted forms: character
representing itself or number encoding character according to ASCII table.
In case of ambiguous characters (dash, comma, digit) use numeric form.
Accepted characters are in the range from 0 to 255.  Any Unicode character
with code greater than 255 is considered to be part of a word.

The option affects Alt-D, Alt-B and Alt-F, but not Ctrl-W.  This is
intentionally to allow two use cases:

 \- Moving by WORDS and deletion by words.
 \- Moving by words and deletion by WORDS.

To get the latter use the following mapping:

<cr> and <c-m>;
.IP \- 2
<tab> and <c-i>;
.IP \- 2
<c-h> and <bs>;
.IP \- 2
etc.
.RE

Most of the time they are defined consistenly and don't cause surprises, but
<c-h> and <bs> are treated differently in different environments (although they
match each other all the time), that's why they correspond to different keys
in vifm.  As a consequence, if you map <c-h> or <bs> be sure to map the other
one to the same combination so that the mapping will work in all environments.

vifm removes whitespace characters at the beginning and end of commands.
That's why you may want to use <space> at the end of rhs in mappings.  For
example:

.EX
  cmap <f1> man<space>
.EE

will put "man " in line when you hit the <f1> key in the command line mode.

          fileview * defviewer %c
      endif
  endif
.EE

.BI expand({expr})

Expands environment variables and macros in {expr} just like it's done for
command-line commands.  Returns a string.  See "Command macros" section above.
.br

Examples:

.EX
  " percent sign
  :echo expand('%%')
  " the last part of directory name of the other pane
  :echo expand('%D:t')
  " $PATH environment variable (same as `:echo $PATH`)

.EE

.BI filetype({fnum})

The result is a string, which represents file type and is one of the list:
    exe    executables
    reg    regular files
    link   symbolic links
    dir    directories
    char   character devices
    block  block devices
    fifo   pipes

Parameter {fnum} can have following values:
    \- '.' to get type of file under the cursor in the active pane

.BI has({property})

Allows examining internal parameters from scripts to e.g. figure out
environment in which application is running.  Returns 1 if property is
true/present, otherwise 0 is returned.  Currently the following properties
are supported (anything else will yield 0):
    unix  runs in *nix-like environment (including Cygwin)
    win   runs on Windows
.br

Usage example:

.EX
  " skip user/group on Windows

.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Custom views
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.B Definition

Normally file views contain list of files from a single directory, but
sometimes it's useful to populate them with list of files that do not belong
to the same directory, which is what custom views are for.

.B Presentation

Custom views are still related to directory they were in before custom list
was loaded.  Path to that directory (original directory) can be seen in the
title of a custom view.

Files in same directory have to be named differently, this doesn't hold for
custom views thus seeing just file names might be rather confusing.  In order
to give an idea where files come from and when possible, relative paths to
original directory of the view is displayed, otherwise full path is used
instead.

Custom views normally don't contain any inexistent files.

.B Navigation

Custom views have some differences related to navigation in regular views.

gf - acts similar to gf on symbolic links and navigates to the file at its real
     location.

h, gh - return to the original directory.

Opening ".." entry also causes return to the original directory.

.B History

Custom list exists only while it's visible, once left one can't return to it,
so there is no appearances of it in any history.

.B Filters

Only local filter affects content of the view.  This is intentional,
presumably if one loads list, precisely that list should be displayed (except
for inexistent paths, which are ignored).

.B Search

Although directory names are visible in listing, they are not searchable.  Only
file names are taken into account (might be changed in future, searching whole
lines seems quite reasonable).

.B Sorting

Contrary to search sorting by name works on whole visible part of file path.

.B Highlight

Whole file name is highlighted as one entity, even if there are directory
elements.

.B Updates

Reloads can occur, though they are not automatic due to files being scattered
among different places.  On a reload, inexistent files are removed and meta-data
of all other files is updated.

Once custom view forgets about the file, it won't add it back even if it's
created again.  So not seeing file previously affected by an operation, which
was undone is normal.

.B Operations

All operations that add files are forbidden for custom views.  For example,
moving/copying/putting files into a custom view doesn't work, because it doesn't
make much sense.

On the other hand, operations that use files of a custom view as a source
(e.g. yanking, copying, moving file from custom view, deletion) and operations
that modify names are all allowed.

.SH Startup
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
On startup vifm determines several variables that are used during the session.
They are determined in the order they appear below.

On *nix systems $HOME is normally present and used as is.
On Windows systems vifm tries to find correct home directory in the following
order:
 \- $HOME variable;
 \- $USERPROFILE variable (on Windows only);
 \- a combination of $HOMEDRIVE and $HOMEPATH variables (on Windows only).

vifm tries to find correct configuration directory by checking the following
places:
 \- $VIFM variable;
 \- parent directory of the executable file (on Windows only);
 \- $HOME/.vifm directory;
 \- $APPDATA/Vifm directory (on Windows only);
 \- $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vifm directory;
 \- $HOME/.config/vifm directory.

vifm tries to find correct configuration file by checking the following places:
 \- $MYVIFMRC variable;
 \- vifmrc in parent directory of the executable file (on Windows only);
 \- $VIFM/vifmrc file.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Configure
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
See "Startup" section above for the explanations on $VIFM and $MYVIFMRC.

The vifmrc file contains commands that will be executed on vifm startup.  There
are two such files: global and local.  Global one is at
{prefix}/etc/vifm/vifmrc, see $MYVIFMRC variable description for the search
algorithm used to find local vifmrc.  Global vifmrc is loaded before the local
one, so that the later one can redefine anything configured globally.

Use vifmrc to set settings, mappings, filetypes etc.  To use multi line commands
precede each next line with a slash (whitespace before slash is ignored, but all
spaces at the end of the lines are saved).  For example:

.EX
  set
      \\smartcase
.EE

equals "setsmartcase".  When

.EX
  set<space here>
      \\ smartcase
.EE

equals "set  smartcase".

The $VIFM/vifminfo file contains session settings.  You may edit it by hand
to change the settings, but it's not recommended to do that, edit vifmrc
instead.  You can control what settings will be saved in vifminfo by setting
\(aqvifminfo\(aq option.  Vifm always writes this file on exit unless 'vifminfo'
option is empty.  Bookmarks, commands, histories, filetypes, fileviewers
and registers in the file are merged with vifm configuration (which has bigger
priority).

Generally, runtime configuration has bigger priority during merging, but there
are some exceptions:
.RS 2

.RE

The $VIFM/scripts directory can contain shell scripts.  vifm modifies
its PATH environment variable to let user run those scripts without specifying
full path.  All subdirectories of the $VIFM/scripts will be added to PATH too.
Script in a subdirectory overlaps script with the same name in all its parent
directories.

The $VIFM/colors/ and {prefix}/etc/vifm/colors/ directories contain color
schemes.  Available color schemes are searched in that order, so on name
conflict the one in $VIFM/colors/ wins.

Each color scheme should have ".vifm" extension.  This wasn't the case before
and for this reason the following rules apply during lookup:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
if there is no file with .vifm extension, all regular files are listed;
.IP \- 2
otherwise only files with .vifm extension are listed (with the extension
being truncated).

.SH Automatic FUSE mounts
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
vifm has a builtin support of automated FUSE file system mounts.  It is \
implemented using file associations mechanism.  To enable automated mounts, \
one needs to use a specially formated program line in filetype or \
filextype commands.  Currently two formats are supported:

1) FUSE_MOUNT
This format should be used in case when all information needed for mounting \
all files of a particular type is the same.  E.g. mounting of tar files \
don't require any file specific options.

Format line:
  FUSE_MOUNT|mounter %SOURCE_FILE %DESTINATION_DIR [%FOREGROUND]

Example filetype command:

.EX
  :filetype FUSE_MOUNT|fuse\-zip %SOURCE_FILE %DESTINATION_DIR
.EE

2) FUSE_MOUNT2
This format allows one to use specially formatted files to perform mounting \
and is useful for mounting remotes, for example remote file systems over ftp \
or ssh.

Format line:
  FUSE_MOUNT2|mounter %PARAM %DESTINATION_DIR [%FOREGROUND]

Example filetype command:

.EX
  :filetype FUSE_MOUNT2|sshfs %PARAM %DESTINATION_DIR
.EE

Example file content:

.EX
  root@127.0.0.1:/
.EE

All % macros are expanded by vifm at runtime and have the following meaning:
  \- %SOURCE_FILE is replaced by full path to selected file;
  \- %DESTINATION_DIR is replaced by full path to mount directory, which is \
created by vifm basing on the value of 'fusehome' option;
  \- %PARAM value is filled from the first line of file (whole line), though \
in the future it can be changed to whole file content;
  \- %FOREGROUND means that you want to run mount command as a regular \
command (required to be able to provide input for communication with mounter \
in interactive way).

%FOREGROUND is an optional macro.  Other macros are not mandatory, but mount \
commands likely won't work without them.

%CLEAR is obsolete name of %FOREGROUND, which is still supported, but might be \
removed in future.  Its use is discouraged.

The mounted FUSE file systems will be automatically unmounted in two cases:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
when vifm quits (with ZZ, :q, etc. or when killed by signal);
.IP \- 2
when you explicitly leave mount point going up to its parent directory (with \
h, Enter on "../" or ":cd ..") and other pane is not in the same directory or \
its child directories.
.RE
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH View look
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
vifm supports displaying of file list view in two different ways:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
in a table mode, when multiple columns can be set using 'viewcolumns' option
(see "Column view" section below for details);
.IP \- 2
in a multicolumn list manner which looks almost like `ls \-x` command output
(see "ls-like view" section below for details).
.RE

The look is local for each view and can be chosen by changing value of the
\(aqlsview\(aq boolean option.

Depending on view look some of keys change their meaning to allow more natural
cursor moving.  This concerns mainly h, j, k, l and other similar navigation
keys.

Also some of options can be ignored if they don't affect view displaying in
selected look.  For example value of 'viewcolumns' when 'lsview' is set.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH ls-like view
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
When this view look is enabled by setting 'lsview' option on, vifm will display
files in multiple columns.  Number of columns depends on the length of the
longest file name present in current directory of the view.  Whole file list is
automatically reflowed on directory change, terminal or view resize.

View looks close to output of `ls \-x` command, so files are listed left to
right in rows.

In this mode file manipulation commands (e.g. d) don't work line-wise like they
do in Vim, since such operations would be uncommon for file manipulating
tasks.  Thus, for example, dd will remove only current file.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Column view
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
View columns are described by a comma-separated list of column descriptions,
each of which has the following format
    [ '\-' ] [ fw ( [ '.' tw ] | '%' ) ] '{' type '}' '.'{0,3}
.br
where fw stands for full width and tw stands for text width.

So it basically consists of four parts:
 1. Optional alignment specifier
 2. Optional width specifier
 3. Mandatory column name
 4. Optional cropping specifier

.B Alignment specifier

It's an optional minus sign as the first symbol of the string.

Specifies type of text alignment within a column.  Two types are supported:
.IP \- 2
left align

.EX
  set viewcolumns=\-{name}
.EE
.IP \- 2
right align (default)

.EX
  set viewcolumns={name}
.EE
.LP
.B Width specifier

It's a number followed by a percent sign, two numbers (second one should be
less than or equal to the first one) separated with a dot or a single number.

Specifies column width and its units. There are tree size types:
.IP \- 2
absolute size \- column width is specified in characters

.EX
  set viewcolumns=\-100{name},20.15{ext}
.EE

results in two columns with lengths of 100 and 20 and a reserved space of five \
characters on the left of second column.
.IP \- 2
relative (percent) size \- column width is specified in percents of view width

.EX
  set viewcolumns=\-80%{name},15%{ext},5%{mtime}
.EE

results in three columns with lengths of 80/100, 15/100 and 5/100 of view width.
.IP \- 2
auto size (default) \- column width is automatically determined

.EX
  set viewcolumns=\-{name},{ext},{mtime}
.EE

results in three columns with length of one third of view width. There is no \
size adjustment to content, since it will slow down rendering.
.LP
Columns of different sizing types can be freely mixed in one view. Though
sometimes some of columns can be seen partly or be completely invisible if
there is not enough space to display them.
.LP
.B Column name

This is just a sort key surrounded with curly braces, e.g.

.EX
  {name},{ext},{mtime}
.EE

{name} and {iname} keys are the same and present both for consistency with
\(aqsort\(aq option.

Empty curly braces ({}) are replaced with the default secondary column for
primary sort key. So after the next command view will be displayed almost as
if 'viewcolumns' is empty, but adding ellipsis for long file names:

.EX
  set viewcolumns=\-{name}..,6{}.
.EE
.LP
.B Cropping specifier

It's from one to three dots after closing curly brace in column format.

Specifies type of text truncation if it doesn't fit in the column.  Currently
tree types are supported:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
truncation \- text is truncated

.EX
  set viewcolumns=\-{name}.
.EE

results in truncation of names that are too long too fit in the view.
.IP \- 2
adding of ellipsis \- ellipsis on the left or right are added when needed

.EX
  set viewcolumns=\-{name}..
.EE

results in that ellipsis are added at the end of too long file names.
.IP \- 2
none (default) \- text can pass column boundaries

.EX
  set viewcolumns=\-{name}...,{ext}
.EE

results in that long file names can partially be written on the ext column.

.SH Color schemes
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The color schemes in vifm can be applied in two different ways:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
as the primary color scheme;
.IP \- 2
as local to a pane color scheme.
.RE

Both types are set using :colorscheme command, but of different forms:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
:colorscheme color_scheme_name \- for the primary color scheme;
.IP \- 2
:colorscheme color_scheme_name directory \- for local color schemes.
.RE

Look of different parts of the TUI (Text User Interface) is determined in \
this way:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
Border, TopLineSel, TopLine, CmdLine, ErrorMsg, StatusLine, JobLine and \
WildMenu are always determined by the primary color scheme;
.IP \- 2
CurrLine, Selected, Directory, Link, BrokenLink, Socket, Device, Executable, \
Fifo and Win are determined by primary color scheme and a set of local \
color schemes, which can be empty.
.RE

There might be a set of local color schemes because they are structured
hierarchically according to file system structure. For example, having the
following piece of file system:
.EX

  ~
  `\-\- bin
     |
     `\-\- my

.EE
Two color schemes:
.EX

  # ~/.vifm/colors/for_bin
  highlight Win cterm=none ctermfg=white ctermbg=red
  highlight CurrLine cterm=none ctermfg=red ctermbg=black

  # ~/.vifm/colors/for_bin_my
  highlight CurrLine cterm=none ctermfg=green ctermbg=black

.EE
And these three commands in the vifmrc file:
.EX

  colorscheme Default
  colorscheme for_bin ~/bin
  colorscheme for_bin_my ~/bin/my

.EE
File list will look in the following way for each level:
.IP \- 2
~/ \- Default color scheme
.br
black background
.br
cursor with blue background
.IP \- 2
~/bin/ \- mix of Default and for_bin color schemes
.br
red background
.br
cursor with black background and red foreground
.IP \- 2
~/bin/my/ \- mix of Default, for_bin and for_bin_my color schemes
.br
red background
.br
cursor with black background and green foreground
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Trash directory
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
vifm has support of trash directory, which is used as temporary storage for
deleted files or files that were cut.  Using trash is controlled by the
\(aqtrash\(aq option, and exact path to the trash can be set with 'trashdir'
option.  Trash directory in vifm differs from the system-wide one by default,
because of possible incompatibilities of storing deleted files among different
file managers.  But one can set 'trashdir' to "~/.local/share/Trash" to use a
"standard" trash directory.

There are two scenarios of using trash in vifm:
.RS 2
.IP 1. 3
As a place for storing files that were cut by "d" and may be inserted to some
other place in file system.
.IP 2. 3
As a storage of files, that are deleted but not purged yet.
.RE

The first scenario uses deletion ("d") operations to put files to trash and
put ("p") operations to restore files from trash directory.  Note that such
operations move files to and from trash directory, which can be long term
operations in case of different partitions or remote drives mounted locally.

The second scenario uses deletion ("d") operations for moving files to trash
directory and :empty command-line command to purge all previously deleted files.

Deletion and put operations depend on registers, which can point to files in
trash directory.  Normally, there are no nonexistent files in registers, but
vifm doesn't keep track of modifications under trash directory, so one
shouldn't expect value of registers to be absolutely correct if trash
directory was modified not by operation that are meant for it.  But this
won't lead to any issues with operations, since they ignore nonexistent
files.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Client\-Server
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
vifm supports remote execution of command-line mode commands as well as remote
changing of directories.  This is possible using \-\-remote command-line
argument.

To execute a command remotely combine \-\-remote argument with \-c <command> or
+<command>.  For example:

.EX
  vifm \-\-remote \-c 'cd /'
  vifm \-\-remote '+cd /'
.EE

To change directory not using command-line mode commands one can specify paths
right after \-\-remote argument, like this:

.EX
  vifm \-\-remote /
  vifm \-\-remote ~
  vifm \-\-remote /usr/bin /tmp
.EE

At the moment there is no way of specifying, which instance of vifm should
arguments be sent.  The main purpose of \-\-remote argument is to provide
support of using vifm as a single-instance application.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Plugin
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plugin for using vifm in vim as a file selector.

Commands:

  :EditVifm   select a file or files to open in the current buffer.
  :SplitVifm  split buffer and select a file or files to open.
  :VsplitVifm vertically split buffer and select a file or files to open.
  :DiffVifm   select a file or files to compare to the current file with
              :vert diffsplit.
  :TabVifm    select a file or files to open in tabs.

Each command accepts up to two arguments: left pane directory and right pane
directory.  After arguments are checked, vifm process is spawned in a special
"file-picker" mode.  To pick files just open them either by pressing l, i or
Enter keys, or by running :edit command.  If no files are selected, file
under the cursor is opened, otherwise whole selection is passed to the plugin
and opened in vim.

The plugin have only two settings.  It's a string variable named g:vifm_term to
let user specify command to run GUI terminal.  By default it's equal to
\(aqxterm \-e\(aq.  And another string variable named g:vifm_exec, which equals
"vifm" by default and specifies path to vifm's executable.  To pass arguments to
vifm use g:vifm_exec_args, which is empty by default.

To use the plugin copy the vifm.vim file to either the system wide vim/plugin
directory or into ~/.vim/plugin.

If you would prefer not to use the plugin and it is in the system wide plugin
directory add

let loaded_vifm=1

to your ~/.vimrc file.
