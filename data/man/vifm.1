.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH SYNOPSIS
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
vifm [OPTION]...
.br
vifm [OPTION]... path
.br
vifm [OPTION]... path path
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vifm is an ncurses based file manager with vi like keybindings.  If you use vi,
vifm gives you complete keyboard control over your files without having to learn
a new set of commands.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH OPTIONS
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
vifm starts in the current directory unless it is given a different directory
on the command line or 'vifminfo' option includes "savedirs" (in which case
last visited directories are used as defaults).
.TP
.BI -
Read list of files from standard input stream and compose custom view out of
them (see "Custom views" section).  Current working directory is used as a base
for relative paths.
.TP
.BI <path>
Starts Vifm in the specified path.
.TP
.BI "<path> <path>"
Starts Vifm in the specified paths.
.LP
Specifying two directories triggers split view even when vifm was in single-view
mode on finishing previous run.  To suppress this behaviour :only command can be
put in the vifmrc file.
.LP
When only one path argument is found on command-line, the left/top pane is
automatically set as the current view.
.LP
Paths to files are also allowed in case you want vifm to start with some
archive opened.
.TP
.BI "\-\-select <path>"
Open parent directory of the given path and select specified file in it.
.TP
.BI \-f
Makes vifm instead of opening files write selection to $VIFM/vimfiles and quit.
.TP
.BI "\-\-choose-files <path>|\-"
Sets output file to write selection into on exit instead of opening files.
"\-" means standard output.  Use empty value to disable it.
.TP
.BI "\-\-choose-dir <path>|\-"
Sets output file to write last visited directory into on exit.  "\-" means
standard output.  Use empty value to disable it.
.TP
.BI "\-\-delimiter <delimiter>"
Sets separator for list of file paths written out by vifm.  Empty value means
null character.  Default is new line character.
.TP
.BI "\-\-on\-choose <command>"
Sets command to be executed on selected files instead of opening them.  The
command may use any of macros described in "Command macros" section below.  The
command is executed once for whole selection.
.TP
.BI "\-\-plugins\-dir <path>"
Additional plugins directory (can appear multiple times).  The last one
added has the highest priority.
.TP
.BI "\-\-logging[=<startup log path>]"
Log some operational details to $XDG_DATA_HOME/vifm/log or $VIFM/log.  If
the optional startup log path is specified and permissions allow one to
open it for writing, then logging of early initialization (before
configuration directories are determined) is put there.
.TP
.BI \-\-server\-list
List available server names and exit.
.TP
.BI "\-\-server\-name <name>"
Name of target or this instance (sequential numbers are appended on name
conflict).
.TP
.BI "\-\-remote"
Sends the rest of the command line to another instance of vifm, \-\-server\-name
is treated just like any other argument and should precede \-\-remote on the
command line.  When there is no server, quits silently.  There is no limit on
how many arguments can be processed.  One can combine \-\-remote with \-c
<command> or +<command> to execute commands in already running instance of vifm.
See also "Client\-Server" section below.
.TP
.BI "\-\-remote-expr"
passes expression to vifm server and prints result.  See also "Client\-Server"
section below.
.TP
.BI "\-c <command> or +<command>"
Run command-line mode <command> on startup.  Commands in such arguments are
executed in the order they appear in command line.  Commands with spaces or
special symbols must be enclosed in double or single quotes or all special
symbols should be escaped (the exact syntax strongly depends on shell).  "+"
argument is equivalent to "$" and thus picks last item of of the view.
.TP
.BI "\-\-help, \-h"
Show a brief command summary and exit vifm.
.TP
.BI "\-\-version, \-v"
Show version information and quit.
.TP
.BI \-\-no\-configs
Skip reading vifmrc and vifminfo.

.LP
See "Startup" section below for the explanations on $VIFM.
.br
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH General keys
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.TP
.BI "Ctrl-C or Escape"
cancel most operations (see "Cancellation" section below), clear all selected
files.  In addition to that Escape also aborts waiting for more input when the
current input is insufficient for determining the shortcut.

.BI "Ctrl-W l"
switch to the right pane.

.TP
.BI "Ctrl-W b"
switch to bottom-right window.
.TP
.BI "Ctrl-W t"

.LP
For Ctrl-W +, Ctrl-W \-, Ctrl-W <, Ctrl-W >, Ctrl-W | and Ctrl-W _ commands
count can be given before and/or after Ctrl-W.  The resulting count
is a multiplication of those two.  So "2 Ctrl-W 2 \-" decreases
window size by 4 lines or columns.

Ctrl-W | and Ctrl-W _ maximise current view by default.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Marks
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.TP
Marks are set the same way as they are in vi.
.LP
You can use these characters for marks [a\-z][A\-Z][0\-9].
.TP
.BI m[a\-z][A\-Z][0\-9]
set a mark for the file at the current cursor position.
.TP
.BI '[a\-z][A\-Z][0\-9]
navigate to the file set for the mark.

.LP
There are also several special marks that can't be set manually:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
\(aq (single quote) \- previously visited directory of the view, thus hitting
\(aq\(aq allows switching between two last locations
.IP \- 2
< \- the first file of the last visually selected block
.IP \- 2
> \- the last file of the last visually selected block
.RE
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Searching
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.TP
.BI "/regular expression pattern"
search for files matching regular expression in forward direction and advance
cursor to next match.
.TP
.BI "/"
perform forward search with top item of search pattern history.
.TP
.BI "?regular expression pattern"
search for files matching regular expression in backward direction and advance
cursor to previous match.
.TP
.BI "?"
perform backward search with top item of search pattern history.
.TP
Trailing slash for directories is taken into account, so /\\/ searches for \
directories and symbolic links to directories.  At the moment // works too, \
but this can change in the future, so consider escaping the slash if not \
typing pattern by hand.
.TP
Matches are automatically selected if 'hlsearch' is set.  Enabling 'incsearch' \
makes search interactive.  'ignorecase' and 'smartcase' options affect case \
sensitivity of search queries as well as local filter and other things \
detailed in the description of 'caseoptions'.

.TP
.BI [count]n
go to the next file matching last search pattern.  Takes last search direction
into account.
.TP
.BI [count]N
go to the previous file matching last search pattern.  Takes last search
direction into account.
.TP
If 'hlsearch' option is set, hitting n/N to perform a search and go to \
a matching item can reset existing selection in normal mode.  It happens when \
there are no prior search results (i.e., no files with highlighting of the \
matched part), otherwise the selection is left as is.  Resetting search \
matches in any way (like running :nohlsearch or pressing Escape) will force \
the search next time n/N is pressed and cause matching files to be selected.
.LP
See also "Regular expressions" section.

.TP
.BI [count]f[character]
search forward for file with [character] as first character in name.  Search
wraps around the end of the list.
.TP
.BI [count]F[character]
search backward for file with [character] as first character in name.  Search
wraps around the end of the list.
.TP
.BI [count];
find the next match of f or F.
.TP
.BI [count],
find the previous match of f or F.
.LP
Note: f, F, ; and , wrap around list beginning and end when they are used
alone and they don't wrap when they are used as selectors.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH File Filters
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are three basic file filters:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
dot files filter (does not affect "." and ".." special directories, whose
appearance is controlled by the 'dotdirs' option), see 'dotfiles' option;
.IP \- 2
permanent filter;
.IP \- 2
local filter (see description of the "=" normal mode command).
.RE

Permanent filter essentially allows defining a group of files names which are
not desirable to be seen by default, like temporary or backup files, which
might be created alongside normal ones.  Just like you don't usually need to
see hidden dot files (files starting with a dot).  Local filter on the other
hand is for temporary immediate filtering of file list at hand, to get rid of
uninterested files in the view or to make it possible to use % range in a
:command.

For the purposes of more deterministic editing permanent filter is split
into two parts:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
one edited explicitly via :filter command;
.IP \- 2
another one which is edited implicitly via zf shortcut.
.RE

Files are tested against both parts and a match counts if at least one
of the parts matched.

.TP
Each file list has its own copy of each filter.
.TP
Filtered files are not checked in / search or :commands.
.TP
Files and directories are filtered separately.  This is done by appending \
a slash to a directory name before testing whether it matches the filter. \
Examples:

.EX
.LP
  " filter directories which names end with '.files'
  :filter /^.*\\.files\\/$/

  " filter files which names end with '.d'
  :filter {*.d}

  " filter files and directories which names end with '.o'
  :filter /^.*\\.o\\/?$/
.EE

See also "Regular expressions" and "Patterns" sections.

The basic Vim folding key bindings are used for managing filters.

.TP
.BI za
toggle visibility of dot files.
.TP
.BI zo
show dot files.
.TP
.BI zm
hide dot files.
.TP
.BI zf
add selected files to permanent filter.
.TP
.BI zO
reset permanent filter.
.TP
.BI zR
save and reset all filters.
.TP
.BI zr
clear local filter.
.TP
.BI zM
restore all filters (undoes last zR).
.TP
.BI zd
exclude selection or current file from a custom view.  Does nothing for regular
view.  For tree view excluding directory excludes that sub-tree.  For compare
views zd hides group of adjacent identical files, count can be specified as 1 to
exclude just single file or selected items instead.  Files excluded this way are
not counted as filtered out and can't be returned unless view is reloaded.
.TP
.BI "=regular expression pattern"
filter out files that don't match regular expression.  Whether view is updated
as regular expression is changed depends on the value of the 'incsearch' option.
This kind of filter is automatically reset when directory is changed.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Tree-related Keys
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
While some of the keys make sense outside of tree-view, they are most useful
in trees.
.TP
.BI [z
go to first sibling of current entry.
.TP
.BI ]z
go to last sibling of current entry.
.TP
.BI zj
go to next directory sibling of current entry or do nothing.
.TP
.BI zk
go to previous directory sibling of current entry or do nothing.
.TP
.BI zx
toggle fold under the cursor or parent entry of the current file if cursor
is not on a directory.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Other Normal Mode Keys
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.TP
.BI [count]:
enter command line mode.  [count] generates range.
.TP
.BI q:
open external editor to prompt for command-line command.  See
"Command line editing" section for details.
.TP
.BI q/
open external editor to prompt for search pattern to be searched in forward
direction.  See "Command line editing" section for details.
.TP
.BI q?
open external editor to prompt for search pattern to be searched in backward
direction.  See "Command line editing" section for details.
.TP
.BI q=
open external editor to prompt for filter pattern.  See "Command line editing"
section for details.  Unlike other q{x} commands this one doesn't work in Visual
mode.
.TP
.BI "[count]!! and [count]!<selector>"
enter command line mode with entered ! command.  [count] modifies range.
.TP
.BI Ctrl-O
go backwards through directory history of current view.  Nonexistent directories
are automatically skipped.
.TP
.BI Ctrl-I
if 'cpoptions' contains "t" flag, <tab> and <c-i> switch active pane just like
<space> does, otherwise it goes forward through directory history of current
view.  Nonexistent directories are automatically skipped.
.TP
.BI Ctrl-G
show a dialog with detailed information about current file.  See
"Menus and dialogs" section for controls.
.TP
.BI "Shift-Tab"
enter view mode (works only after activating view pane with :view command).
.TP
.BI ga
calculate directory size.  Uses cached directory sizes when possible for better
performance.  As a special case calculating size of ".." entry results in
calculation of size of current directory.
.TP
.BI gA
like ga, but force update.  Ignores old values of directory sizes.
.LP
If file under cursor is selected, each selected item is processed, otherwise
only current file is updated.
.TP
.BI gf
find link destination (like l with 'followlinks' off, but also finds
directories).  On Windows additionally follows .lnk-files.
.TP
.BI gF
Same as gf, but resolves final path of the chain of symbolic links.
.TP
.BI gr
only for MS-Windows
.br
same as l key, but tries to run program with administrative privileges.
.TP
.BI av
go into visual mode for updating current selection, any existing selection
is preserved.
.TP
.BI gv
go into visual mode restoring last selection.
.TP
.BI [reg]gs
if register is present, then all files listed in that register that are
visible in current view are selected.

When no register is specified, restore the last selection saved for this
view (similar to what gv does for visual mode selection).  When you
leave a directory, its saved selection is remembered for that path and
visiting the directory again restores it.  Selection for up to 10 distinct
file-system locations are remembered.
.TP
.BI gu<selector>
make names of selected files lowercase.
.TP
.BI "[count]guu and [count]gugu"
make names of [count] files starting from the current one lowercase.  Without
[count] only current file is affected.
.TP
.BI gU<selector>
make names of selected files uppercase.
.TP
.BI "[count]gUU and [count]gUgU"
make names of [count] files starting from the current one uppercase.  Without
[count] only current file is affected.
.TP
.BI e
explore file in the current pane.
.TP
.BI i
handle file (even if it's an executable and 'runexec' option is set).
.TP
.BI cw
change word is used to rename a file or files.  If multiple files are selected,
behaves as :rename command run without arguments.
.TP
.BI cW
change WORD is used to change only name of file (without extension).
.TP
.BI cl
change link target.  If multiple files are selected, an editor is spawn
to edit paths.
.TP
.BI co
only for *nix
.br
change file owner.
.TP
.BI cg
only for *nix
.br
change file group.
.TP
.BI [count]cp
change file attributes (permission on *nix and properties on Windows).  If
[count] is specified, it's treated as numerical argument for non-recursive
`chmod` command (of the form [0-7]{3,4}).  See "Menus and dialogs" section for
controls.
.TP
.BI [count]C
clone file(s) [count] times.
.TP
.BI "[reg][count]dd"
move files to trash directory if 'trash' option is set,
otherwise delete them permanently.  See "Trash directory" section below.

When "s" is present in 'cpoptions', operates on selected
files or, in the absence of selection, the current one.  When the flag
isn't set, always operates on the current file only.
.TP
.BI "[reg]d[count]<selector>"
like dd, but accepts motions/selectors.
.TP
.BI "[count]DD or D[count]<selector>"
like dd and d<selector>, but always omits trash directory (even
when 'trash' option is set).  Affected by "s" flag in 'cpoptions'.
.TP
.BI "[reg][count]Y or [reg][count]yy"
yank files.

When "s" is present in 'cpoptions', operates on selected
files or, in the absence of selection, the current one.  When the flag
isn't set, always operates on the current file only.
.TP
.BI "[reg]y[count]<selector>"
yank files specified by motion/selector.
.TP
.BI [reg]p
copy yanked files to the current directory or move the files to the current
directory if they were deleted with dd or :d[elete] or if the files were yanked
from trash directory.  See "Trash directory" and "File copying" sections below.
.TP
.BI [reg]P
move the last yanked files.  The advantage of using P instead of d followed by
p is that P moves files only once.  This isn't important in case you're moving
files in the same file system where your home directory is, but using P to
move files on some other file system (or file systems, in case you want to move
files from fs1 to fs2 and your home is on fs3) can save your time.
.TP
.BI [reg]al
put symbolic links with absolute paths.
.TP
.BI [reg]rl
put symbolic links with relative paths.
.TP
.BI t
select or unselect (tag) the current file.
.TP
.BI u
undo last change.
.TP
.BI Ctrl-R
redo last change.
.TP
.BI dp
in compare view of "ofboth grouppaths" kind makes corresponding entries
of the other pane equal to the current one.  If at least one file is
selected, the command processes selection, otherwise current file.
.br
The semantics is as follows:
 \- nothing is done for identical entries
 \- if file is missing in current view, its pair gets removed
 \- if file is missing or differs in other view, it's replaced
 \- file pairs are defined by matching relative paths
.br
File removal obeys 'trash' option.  When the option is enabled, the operation
can be undone/redone (although results won't be visible automatically).
.br
Unlike in Vim, this operation is performed on a single line rather than
a set of adjacent changes.
.TP
.BI do
same as dp, but applies changes in the opposite direction.
.TP
.BI "v or V"
enter visual mode, clears current selection.
.TP
.BI [count]Ctrl-A
increment first number in file name by [count] (1 by default).
.TP
.BI [count]Ctrl-X
decrement first number in file name by [count] (1 by default).
.TP
.BI ZQ
same as :quit!.
.TP
.BI ZZ
same as :quit.
.TP
.BI .
repeat last command-line command (not normal mode command) of this run (does
nothing right after startup or :restart command).  The command doesn't depend on
command-line history and can be used with completely disabled history.
.TP
.BI (
go to previous group.  Groups are defined by primary sorting key.  For name and
iname members of each group have same first letter, for all other sorting keys
vifm uses size, uid, ...
.TP
.BI )
go to next group.  See ( key description above.
.TP
.BI {
speeds up navigation to closest previous entry of the opposite type by
moving to the first file backwards when cursor is on a directory and
to the first directory backwards when cursor is on a file.  This is
essentially a special case of ( that is locked on "dirs".
.TP
.BI }
same as {, but in forward direction.
.TP
.BI [c
go to previous mismatched entry in directory comparison view or do nothing.
.TP
.BI ]c
go to next mismatched entry in directory comparison view or do nothing.
.TP
.BI [d
go to previous directory entry or do nothing.
.TP
.BI ]d
go to next directory entry or do nothing.
.TP
.BI [r
same as :siblprev.
.TP
.BI ]r
same as :siblnext.
.TP
.BI [R
same as :siblprev!.
.TP
.BI ]R
same as :siblnext!.
.TP
.BI [s
go to the previous selected entry or do nothing.
.TP
.BI ]s
go to the next selected entry or do nothing.

.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Using Count
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.TP
You can use count with commands like yy.
.TP
.BI [count]yy
yank count files starting from current cursor position downward.
.TP
Or you can use count with motions passed to y, d or D.
.TP
.BI d[count]j
delete (count + 1) files starting from current cursor position downward.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Registers
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.LP
vifm supports multiple registers to temporary store lists of yanked and/or
deleted files.

Registers are specified by pressing double quote key followed by a register
name before typing a command.  Count is specified after a register name.
By default commands use unnamed register, which has double quote as its name.

Though all commands accept registers, most commands ignore them (for example,
H or Ctrl-U).  Other commands fill a register, append
new files to it or use it as a source of list of files.

Presently vifm supports ", _, a-z and A-Z characters as register names.

As mentioned above " is unnamed register and has special meaning of the
default register.  Every time a named register (a-z and A-Z) is used, unnamed
register is updated to contain the same list of files.

_ is black hole register.  It can be used for writing, but its list is always
empty.

Registers with names from a to z and from A to Z are named ones.  Lowercase
registers are cleared before adding new files, while uppercase ones aren't and
should be used to append new files to the existing file list of a corresponding
lowercase register (A for a, B for b, ...).

Registers contain each file at most once.  Nonexistent files are dropped from
them.  In particular, registers can be changed on :empty command if they
include files under trash directory (see "Trash directory" section below).

Example:
.EX

  "a2yy

.EE
.br
puts names of two files to register a (and to the unnamed register),
.EX

  "Add

.EE
.br
removes one file and appends its name to register a (and to the unnamed
register),
.EX

  p or "ap or "Ap

.EE
.br

When you pass a count to whole command and its selector they are multiplied. So:

.IP \- 2
2d2j \- delete file under cursor and four below;
.IP \- 2
2dj \- delete file under cursor and two below;

.SH Visual Mode
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Visual mode has two generic operating submodes:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
plain selection as it is in Vim;
.IP \- 2
selection editing submode.
.RE

Both modes select files in range from cursor position at which visual mode was
entered to current cursor position (let's call it "selection region").  Each of
two borders can be adjusted by swapping them via "o" or "O" keys and updating
cursor position with regular cursor motion keys.  Obviously, once initial cursor
position is altered this way, real start position becomes unavailable.

Plain Vim-like visual mode starts with cleared selection, which is not restored
on rejecting selection ("Escape", "Ctrl-C", "v", "V").  Contrary to it,
selection editing doesn't clear previously selected files and restores them
after reject.  Accepting selection by performing an operation on selected
items (e.g. yanking them via "y") moves cursor to the top of current selection
region (not to the top most selected file of the view).

In turn, selection editing supports three types of editing (look at status bar
to know which one is currently active):
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
append \- amend selection by selecting elements in selection region;
.IP \- 2
remove \- amend selection by deselecting elements in selection region;
.IP \- 2
invert \- amend selection by inverting selection of elements in selection \
region.
.RE

No matter how you activate selection editing it starts in "append".  One can
switch type of operation (in the order given above) via "Ctrl-G" key.

Almost all normal mode keys work in visual mode, but instead of accepting
selectors they operate on selected items.

.SH Fast navigation
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to streamline navigation through directory tree, you can enter a
special form of command-line mode from search or local filter prompt.  Once
activated, pressing Enter opens currently selected directory and clears the
prompt in anticipation of the next component of the path.  If entry under the
cursor is a file, it is opened and the mode is finished.

This behaviour is embedded in a command-line mode, but doesn't update input
histories nor expands abbreviations and redefines some of the mode's mappings
for the purpose of faster navigation through the file system rather than
command-line editing.  When on, prompt gets "nav" prefix.

You can enable this behaviour on search by default via a mapping like:
.EX

    nnoremap / /<c-y>

.EE
.TP
.BI Ctrl-Y
enter navigation mode.  Works only for search and local filter started

.SH Command line editing
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
vifm provides a facility to edit several kinds of data, that is usually edited
in command-line mode, in external editor (using command specified by
\(aqvicmd\(aq or 'vixcmd' option).  This has at least two advantages
over built-in command-line mode:
  \- one can use full power of Vim to edit text;
  \- finding and reusing history entries becomes possible.

The facility is supported by four input submodes of the command-line:
  \- command;
  \- forward search;
  \- backward search;
  \- file rename (see description of cw and cW normal mode keys).

Editing command-line using external editor is activated by the Ctrl-G
shortcut.  It's also possible to do almost the same from Normal and Visual
modes using q:, q/ and q? commands.

Temporary file created for the purpose of editing the line has the following
structure:
.RS 2
.IP 1. 3
First line, which is either empty or contains text already entered in
command-line.
.IP 2. 3
2nd and all other lines with history items starting with the most recent one.
Altering this lines in any way won't change history items stored by vifm.
.RE

After editing application is finished the first line of the file is taken as
the result of operation, when the application returns zero exit code.  If the
application returns an error (see :cquit command in Vim), all the edits made to
the file are ignored, but the initial value of the first line is saved in
appropriate history.

Most of the commands have two forms: complete and the short one.
Example:
.EX

  :noh[lsearch]

.EE
This means the complete command is nohlsearch, and the short one is noh.

Most of command-line commands completely reset selection in the current view.
However, there are several exceptions:

.IP \- 2
:if and :else commands don't affect selection on successful execution.

Event name is case insensitive.

{pat} is a comma-separated list of modified globs patterns, which can
contain tilde or environment variables.  All paths use slash ('/') as
directory separator.  The pattern can start with a '!', which negates it.
Patterns that do not contain slashes are matched against the last item of
the path only (e.g. "dir" in "/path/dir").  Literal comma can be entered by
doubling it.  Two modifications to globs matching are as follows:
  \- *  \- never matches a slash (i.e., can signify single directory level)
  \- ** \- matches any character (i.e., can match path of arbitrary depth)

{cmd} is a :command or several of them separated with '|'.

Examples of patterns:
  \- conf.d      \- matches conf.d directory anywhere
  \- *.d         \- matches directories ending with ".d" anywhere
  \- **.git      \- matches something.git, but not .git anywhere
  \- **/.git/**  \- matches /path/.git/objects, but not /path/.git
  \- **/.git/**/ \- matches /path/.git/ only (because of trailing slash)
  \- /etc/*      \- matches /etc/conf.d/, /etc/X11, but not /etc/X11/fs
  \- /etc/**/*.d \- matches /etc/conf.d, /etc/X11/conf.d, etc.

.TP
.BI :colo[rscheme]
display a menu with a list of available color schemes.  You can choose primary
color scheme here.  It is used for view if no directory specific colorscheme
fits current path.  It's also used to set border color (except view titles) and
colors in menus and dialogs.  See "Menus and dialogs" section for controls.
.TP
.BI ":colo[rscheme] color_scheme_name"
change primary color scheme to color_scheme_name.  In case of errors (e.g. some
colors are not supported by terminal) either nothing is changed or color scheme
is reset to builtin colors to ensure that TUI is left in a usable state.
.TP
.BI ":colo[rscheme] color_scheme_name directory"
associate directory with the color scheme.  The directory argument can be either
absolute or relative path when :colorscheme command is executed from command
line, but mandatory should be an absolute path when the command is executed in
scripts loaded at startup (until vifm is completely loaded).
.TP
.BI ":colo[rscheme] color_scheme_name color_scheme_name..."
loads the first color scheme in the order given that exists and is supported

Use :com[mand]! to overwrite a previously set command of the same name.
Builtin commands can't be redefined.
.br
User commands must start with an upper or lower case letter.
Command name can't contain special symbols except for a single trailing
\(aq?' or '!'.  Numbers are allowed provided that they don't cause parsing
ambiguity (no command name prefix that precedes a digit can match an
existing command unless it has a digit in the same place), for example:
.EX
  " good

User commands are run in a shell by default (see below for syntax of other
options).  To run a command in the background you must mark it as a background
command by adding " &" after the command's action (e.g., `:com rm rm %f &`).
.br
User commands of all kinds have macros expanded in them.  See "Command macros"
section for more information.

.TP
.BI ":filet[ype] pattern-list [{descr}]def_prog[ &],[{descr}]prog2[ &],..."
associate given program list to each of the patterns.  Associated
program (command) is used by handlers of l and Enter keys (and also in
the :file menu).  If you need to insert comma into command just double it
(",,").  Space followed by an ampersand as two last characters of a command
means running of the command in the background.  Optional description can be
given to each command to ease understanding of what command will do in the
:file menu.  Vifm will try the rest of the programs for an association when
the default isn't found.  When program entry doesn't contain any of vifm
macros, name of current file is appended as if program entry ended with %c
macro on *nix and %"c on Windows.  On Windows path to executables containing
spaces can (and should be for correct work with such paths) be double quoted.
See "Patterns" section below for pattern definition and "Selection" section for
how selection is handled.  See also "Automatic FUSE mounts" section below.
Example for zip archives and several actions:

.EX
  filetype *.zip,*.jar,*.war,*.ear
         \\ {Mount with fuse-zip}
         \\ FUSE_MOUNT|fuse-zip %SOURCE_FILE %DESTINATION_DIR,
         \\ {View contents}
         \\ zip \-sf %c | less,
         \\ {Extract here}
         \\ tar \-xf %c,
.EE

Note that on OS X when `open` is used to call an app, vifm is unable to
check whether that app is actually available.  So if automatic skipping
of programs that aren't there is desirable, `open` should be replaced
with an actual command.
.TP
.BI ":filet[ype] filename"
list (in menu mode) currently registered patterns that match specified file
name.  Same as ":filextype filename".
.TP
.BI "                                         :filextype"
.TP
.BI ":filex[type] pattern-list [{ description }] def_program,program2,..."
same as :filetype, but this command is ignored if not running in X.
In X :filextype is equal to :filetype.  See "Patterns" section below for pattern
definition and "Selection" section for how selection is handled.  See
also "Automatic FUSE mounts" section below.

For example, consider the following settings (the order might seem strange,
but it's for the demonstration purpose):

.EX
  filetype *.html,*.htm
          \\ {View in lynx}
          \\ lynx
  filextype *.html,*.htm
          \\ {Open with dwb}
          \\ dwb %f %i &,
  filetype *.html,*.htm
          \\ {View in links}
          \\ links
  filextype *.html,*.htm
          \\ {Open with firefox}
          \\ firefox %f &,
          \\ {Open with uzbl}
          \\ uzbl-browser %f %i &,
.EE

If you're using vifm inside a terminal emulator that is running in graphical
environment (when X is used on *nix; always on Windows), vifm attempts to run
application in this order:

1. lynx
.br
2. dwb
.br
3. links
.br
4. firefox
.br
5. uzbl

If there is no graphical environment (checked by presence of non-empty $DISPLAY
or $WAYLAND_DISPLAY environment variable on *nix; never happens on Windows), the
list will look like:

1. lynx
.br
2. links

Just as if all :filextype commands were not there.

The purpose of such differentiation is to allow comfortable use of vifm
with same settings in desktop environment/through remote connection (SSH)/\
in native console.

Note that on OS X $DISPLAY isn't defined unless you define it, so
:filextype should be used only if you set $DISPLAY in some way.
.TP
.BI ":filext[ype] filename"
list (in menu mode) currently registered patterns that match specified file
name.  Same as ":filetype filename".
.TP
.BI "                                         :fileviewer"
.TP
.BI ":filev[iewer] pattern-list command1,command2,..."
register specified list of commands as viewers for each of the patterns.
Viewer is a command which output is captured and displayed in one of the panes
of vifm after pressing "e" or running :view command.  When the command doesn't
contain any of vifm macros, name of current file is appended as if command
ended with %c macro.  Comma escaping and missing commands processing rules as
for :filetype apply to this command.  See "Patterns" section below for pattern
definition.  Supports Lua handlers.

Example for zip archives:
.EX

  fileviewer *.zip,*.jar,*.war,*.ear zip \-sf %c, echo "No zip to preview:"
.EE
.TP
.BI ":filev[iewer] filename"
list (in menu mode) currently registered patterns that match specified filename.

.TP
.BI ":filter[!] {pattern}"
filter files matching the pattern out of directory listings.  '!' controls state
of filter inversion after updating filter value (see also 'cpoptions'
description).  Filter is matched case sensitively on *nix and case insensitively
on Windows.  See "File Filters" and "Patterns" sections.

Column names match names of columns of |vifm-'viewcolumns'| option, which in
turn are based on values of |vifm-'sort'| and custom columns added from Lua.
Regardless of the source, columns are specified as "column:{name}", for
example:
.EX

  highlight column:fileext ctermfg=red
.EE

Available style values (some of them can be combined):
 \- bold
 \- underline
 \- reverse or inverse
 \- standout
 \- italic (on unsupported systems becomes reverse)
 \- combine \- add attributes of current group to attributes of the parent in \
group hierarchy (see below) instead of replacing them
 \- none

Available colors:
 \- \-1 or default or none \- default or transparent
 \- black   and lightblack
 \- red     and lightred
 \- green   and lightgreen
 \- yellow  and lightyellow
 \- blue    and lightblue
 \- magenta and lightmagenta
 \- cyan    and lightcyan
 \- white   and lightwhite
 \- 0-255 \- corresponding colors from 256-color palette (for ctermfg and \
ctermbg)
 \- #rrggbb \- direct ("gui", "true", 24-bit) color in hex-notation, each of \
the three components are in the range 0x00 to 0xff (for guifg and guibg)

Light versions of colors are regular colors with bold attribute set
automatically in terminals that have less than 16 colors.  So order of arguments
of :highlight command is important and it's better to put "cterm" in front of
others to prevent it from overwriting attributes set by "ctermfg" or "ctermbg"
arguments.

For convenience of color scheme authors xterm-like names for 256 color palette
is also supported.  The mapping is taken from
http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Xterm256_color_names_for_console_Vim

There are two colors (foreground and background) and only one bold attribute.
Thus single bold attribute affects both colors when "reverse" attribute is used
in vifm run inside terminal emulator.  At the same time linux native console can
handle boldness of foreground and background colors independently, but for
consistency with terminal emulators this is available only implicitly by using
light versions of colors.  This behaviour might be changed in the future.

Although vifm supports 256 colors in a sense they are supported by UI drawing
library, whether you will be able to use all of them highly depends on your
terminal.  To set up terminal properly, make sure that $TERM in the
environment you run vifm is set to name of 256-color terminal (on *nixes it can
also be set via X resources), e.g. xterm-256color.  One can find list of
available terminal names by listing /usr/lib/terminfo/.  Number of colors
supported by terminal with current settings can be checked via "tput colors"
command.

In order to use 24-bit colors one needs a terminal that supports them,
corresponding terminfo record (probably ends in "\-direct" like in
"xterm-direct") and $TERM pointing to it.  When vifm detects direct color
support "cterm*" values are ignored for groups which have at least one of
"gui*" values set, otherwise they are used after translating via a builtin
palette.

Here is the hierarchy of highlight groups, which you need to know for using
transparency:
  JobLine
  SuggestBox
  StatusLine
    WildBox
      WildMenu
    User1..User20
  Border
  CmdLine
    ErrorMsg
  Win
    OtherWin
      AuxWin
        OddLine
          Column highlights
            File name specific highlights
              Directory
              Link
              BrokenLink
              HardLink
              Socket
              Device
              Fifo
              Executable
                CmpMismatch
                CmpUnmatched
                CmpBlank
                  Selected
                    CurrLine
                      LineNr (in active pane)
                    OtherLine
                      LineNr (in inactive pane)
  TopLine
    TopLineSel
      TabLineSel (for pane tabs)
        User1..User20
  TabLine
    TabLineSel
      User1..User20

"none" means default terminal color for highlight groups at the first level of
the hierarchy and transparency for all others.

Here file name specific highlights mean those configured via globs ({}) or
regular expressions (//).  At most one of them is applied per file entry, namely
the first that matches file name, hence order of :highlight commands might be
important in certain cases.

.TP
.BI :histnext
same as <c-i>.  The main use case for this command is to work around the common
pain point of <tab> and <c-i> being the same ASCII character: one could alter
the terminal emulator settings to emit, for example, the `F1` keycode when
Ctrl-I is pressed, then `:noremap <f1> :histnext<cr>` in vifm, add "t" flag to
the 'cpoptions', and thus have both <c-i> and <tab> working as expected.

.TP
.BI ":if {expr1}"
start conditional block.  Commands are executed until next matching :elseif,
:else or :endif command if {expr1} evaluates to non-zero, otherwise they are
ignored.  An error during evaluation of {expr1} results in not taking any
conditional branches (not even an else-branch).  See also help on :else and
:endif commands.

Example:

.TP
.BI ":locate filename"
use "locate" command to create a menu of filenames.
Selecting a file from the menu will reload the current file list in vifm
to show the selected file.  By default the command relies on the external
"locate" utility (it's assumed that its database is already built), which can be
customized by altering value of the 'locateprg' option.  See "Menus and dialogs"
section for controls.
.TP
.BI :locate

used).  This is achieved by issuing proper command for active terminal
multiplexer, thus the list is not handled by vifm.

file in current directory is used.  If no filename was given and /full/dir/path
is current directory, then the last file of the [range] is used.  Question mark
stops the command from overwriting an existing mark.  Macros and environment
variables are expanded.

turn pane into tree view with current directory as its root.  The tree view is
implemented on top of a custom view, but is automatically kept in sync with
file system state and considers all the filters.  Thus the structure corresponds

for trees built out of custom view file-system tracking isn't performed.

To leave tree view go up from its root or use gh at any level of the tree.  Any
command that changes directory will also do, in particular, `:cd ..`.

Tree structure is incompatible with alternative representations, so values
of 'lsview' and 'millerview' options are ignored.

navigate to a view by its id number.  The {substr} part is used for
completion (can be any number of words, only leading whitespace is
removed).  The view will become the current one by switching to the

.SH Ranges
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ranges implemented include:
  2,3 \- from second to third file in the list (including it)
  % \- the entire directory.
  . \- the current position in the filelist.
  $ \- the end of the filelist.
  't \- the mark position t.

Examples:
.EX

  :%delete

.EE
would delete all files in the directory.
.EX

  :2,4delete

.EE
would delete the files in the list positions 2 through 4.
.EX

  :.,$delete

.EE
would delete the files from the current position to the end of the filelist.
.EX

  :3delete4

.EE
would delete the files in the list positions 3, 4, 5, 6.

If a backward range is given :4,2delete \- an query message is given and
user can chose what to do next.

The builtin commands that accept a range are :d[elete] and :y[ank].
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH :command parameters
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some of the command-line commands accept parameters in the form of
`\-paramname`.  Arguments of such commands can be split into two groups:
parameters and positional arguments.  Items from the two groups cannot be
interleaved and parameters always come first.  List of parameters is
terminated implicitly by the first argument that doesn't start with a
dash ("-") or explicitly via "--" separator (needs to be a separate
argument), which is just discarded.  These strict rules allow arbitrary
positional arguments, such as file names that start with a dash.

.TP
.BI "\-skip parameter"
This parameter makes :copy, :move, :alink and :rlink automatically skip source
files that already exist at the destination rather than refusing to perform the
operation.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Command macros
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The command macros may be used in user commands.
.TP
.BI %a
User arguments.  When user arguments contain macros, they are expanded before
performing substitution of %a.
.TP
.BI "%c %""c"
The current file under the cursor.
.TP
.BI "%C %""C"
The current file under the cursor in the other directory.
.TP
.BI "%f %""f"
All of the selected files or the current file, but see "Selection" section
below.
.TP
.BI "%F %""F"
Same as %f, %"f, but for the inactive pane.
.TP
.BI "%l %""l"
List of selected files.  Unlike %f from above, this is only for
explicit selection (i.e., not via a range) and is empty if no
files are selected.
.TP
.BI "%L %""L"
Same as %l, %"l, but for the inactive pane.
.TP
.BI "%b %""b"
Same as %f %F.
.TP
.BI "%d %""d"
Full path to current directory.
.TP
.BI "%D %""D"
Full path to other file list directory.
.TP
.BI "%rx %""rx"
Full paths to files in the register {x}.
In case of invalid symbol in place of {x}, it's processed with the rest of the
line and default register is used.
.TP
.BI %m
Show command output in a menu.
.TP
.BI %M
Same as %m, but l (or Enter) key is handled like for :locate and :find commands.
.TP
.BI %u
Process command output as list of paths and compose custom view out of it.
.TP
.BI %U
Same as %u, but implies less list updates inside vifm, which is absence of
sorting at the moment.
.TP
.BI %Iu
Same as %u, but gives up terminal before running external command.
.TP
.BI %IU
Same as %U, but gives up terminal before running external command.
.TP
.BI %S
Show command output in the status bar.
.TP
.BI %q
Redirect command output to quick view, which is activated if disabled.
.TP
.BI %s
Execute command in horizontally split window of active terminal multiplexer
(ignored if not running inside one).
.TP
.BI %v
Same as %s, but splits vertically.
.TP
.BI %n
Forbid use of terminal multiplexer to run the command.
.TP
.BI %N
Do not detach viewer from terminal session (keeps `/dev/tty`
available) or process group (keeps the command in the set of
foreground clients of the terminal).  This flag is a workaround
for rare commands/terminals which might need a working TTY for
:fileviewer command to operate correctly and has no effect
otherwise.
.TP
.BI %i
Run in background and suppress error dialogs, but collect
errors internally for viewing via :jobs menu.  This macro
doesn't detach the command from terminal session (`/dev/tty`) on
its own, add " &" to leave the command without access to the
terminal.
.TP
.BI %Pl
Pipe list of files to standard input of a command.
.TP
.BI %Pz
Same as %Pl, but separates paths by null ('\\0') character.
.TP
.BI %pc
Marks the end of the main command and the beginning of the clear command for
graphical preview, which is invoked on closing preview of a file.
.TP
.BI %pd
Marks a preview command as one that directly communicates with the terminal.
Beware that this is for things like sixel which are self-contained sequences
that depend only on current cursor position, using this with anything else is
likely to mangle terminal state.
.TP
.BI %pu
Uncached preview.  Intended to be used for commands that just send file path
somewhere for preview.
.LP
The following dimensions and coordinates are in characters:
.TP
.BI %px
x coordinate of top-left corner of preview area.
.TP
.BI %py
y coordinate of top-left corner of preview area.
.TP
.BI %pw
width of preview area.
.TP
.BI %ph
height of preview area.

.LP
Use %% if you need to put a percent sign in your command.

Note that %i, %Iu, %IU, %m, %M, %n, %q, %s, %S, %u, %U and %v macros are
mutually exclusive.  Only the last one of them in the command will take
effect.

Note that %Pl and %Pz are mutually exclusive.  Only the last one of them in
the command will take effect.

Note that a previewer containing %pd is considered a pass-through previewer,
otherwise a previewer containing both %px and %py is considered to be a
graphical previewer, the rest are treated as text previewers.

You can use file name modifiers after %c, %C, %f, %F, %b, %d and %D macros.
Supported modifiers are:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
:p           \- full path
.IP \- 2
:u           \- UNC name of path (e.g. "\\\\server" in "\\\\server\\share"), Windows only.  Expands to current computer name for not UNC paths.
.IP \- 2
:~           \- relative to the home directory
.IP \- 2
:.           \- relative to current directory
.IP \- 2
:h           \- head of the file name
.IP \- 2
:t           \- tail of the file name
.IP \- 2
:r           \- root of the file name (without last extension)
.IP \- 2
:e           \- extension of the file name (last one)
.IP \- 2
:s?pat?sub?  \- substitute the first occurrence of pat with sub.  You can use any character for '?', but it must not occur in pat or sub.
.IP \- 2
:gs?pat?sub? \- like :s, but substitutes all occurrences of pat with sub.
.RE

See ':h filename\-modifiers' in Vim's documentation for the detailed
description.

Using %x means expand corresponding macro escaping all characters that have
special meaning.  And %"x means using of double quotes and escape only backslash
and double quote characters, which is more useful on Windows systems.

Position and quantity (if there is any) of %m, %M, %S or %s macros in the
command is unimportant.  All their occurrences are removed from the resulting
command.

%c and %f macros are expanded to relative paths, while %C and %F are always
expanded to full paths.  The same applies to %f and %F implicitly used by %b.
.TP
.BI ":com move mv %f %D"
set the :move command to move all of the files selected in the current directory
to the other directory.
.TP
The %a macro is replaced with any arguments given to an alias command.  All \
arguments are considered optional.
:com lsl !!ls \-l %a \- set the lsl command to execute ls \-l with or without an
argument.
.TP
.BI ":lsl<Enter>"
will list the directory contents of the current directory.
.TP
.BI ":lsl filename<Enter>"
will list only the given filename.
.TP
The macros can also be used in directly executing commands.  ":!mv %f %D" \
would move the current directory selected files to the other directory.
.TP
Appending & to the end of a command causes it to be executed in the \
background.  Typically you want to run two kinds of external commands in the \
background:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
GUI applications that doesn't fork thus block vifm (:!sxiv %f &);
.IP \- 2
console tools that do not work with terminal (:!mv %f %D &).
.RE
.TP
You don't want to run terminal commands, which require terminal input or \
output something in background because they will mess up vifm's TUI.  Anyway, \

.TP
Rewriting the example command with macros given above with backgrounding:
.EX
.EE
.LP
%m, %M, %s, %S, %u and %U macros cannot be combined with background mark (" &")
as it doesn't make much sense.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Command backgrounding
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
File system operations can take a lot of time to proceed.  That's why vifm
supports backgrounding them.  To run :copy, :move or :delete
command in background just append " &" to it.

For each background operation a new thread is created.  Job cancellation can
be requested in the :jobs menu via dd shortcut.

You can check if a command is still running in the :jobs menu.
Backgrounded commands have progress instead of process id at the beginning of
the line.

Background operations cannot be undone.

See "File copying" section below.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Cancellation
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note that cancellation works somewhat different on Windows platform due to
different mechanism of break signal propagation.  One also might need to use
Ctrl-Break shortcut instead of Ctrl-C.

There are two types of operations that can be cancelled:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
file system operations;
.IP \- 2
mounting with FUSE (but not unmounting as it can cause loss of data);
.IP \- 2
calls of external applications.
.RE

Note that vifm never terminates applications, it sends SIGINT signal and lets
the application quit normally.

When one of a set of operations is cancelled (e.g. copying of 5th file of 10
files), further operations are cancelled too.  In this case undo history will
contain only actually performed operations.

Cancelled operations are indicated by "(cancelled)" suffix appended to
information message on status bar.

.B File system operations

Currently the following commands can be cancelled: :alink, :chmod, :chown,
:clone, :copy, :delete, :mkdir, :move, :restore, :rlink, :touch.  File
putting (on p/P key) can be cancelled as well.  It's not hard to see that these
are mainly long-running operations.

Cancelling commands when they are repeated for undo/redo operations is allowed
for convenience, but is not recommended as further undo/redo operations might
get blocked by side-effects of partially cancelled group of operations.

These commands can't be cancelled: :empty, :rename, :substitute, :tr.

.B Mounting with FUSE

It's not considered to be an error, so only a notification on the status bar is
shown.

.B External application calls

Each of these operations can be cancelled: :apropos, :find, :grep, :locate.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Selection
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
If there is a selection, it's stashed before proceeding further unless file
under the cursor is part of that selection.  This means that when macros are
expanded for :filetype or :filextype programs, `%f` and `%F`
become equivalent to `%c` and `%C` respectively if current file is not selected.
So you run selection by running one of selected files, otherwise you're running
a single file even if there are other selected entries.

When running a selection it must not include broken symbolic links, has to be
consistent and set of file handlers must be compatible.  Consistency means
that selection contains either only directories (including links to them) or
only files, but not their mix.

Compatibility is a more sophisticated check, but it's defined in a natural way
so that you get what you'd expect.  The following properties of selection are
taken into account while checking it for compatibility and deciding how to
handle it:

.RS 2
.IP 1. 3
If there any files for which handler isn't defined, then all files are opened
using 'vicmd' or 'vixcmd'.

.IP 2. 3
If all handlers match the following criteria:
 - backgrounded
 - include `%c`/`%"c` and/or `%C`/`%"C`
 - include neither `%f`/`%"f` nor `%F`/`%"F`
.br
then each file is executed independently of the rest.

.IP 3. 3
If all handlers are equal, the common handler is executed.  This handler might
ignore selection and process only file under the cursor.

.IP 4. 3
Otherwise, an error is reported, because handlers differ and they don't support
parallel execution.
.RE
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Patterns
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
:highlight, :filetype, :filextype, :fileviewer commands and 'classify' option
support globs, regular expressions and mime types to match file names or their
paths.  Directory paths get an implicit trailing slash on matching against a
pattern, keep that in mind for globs or regular expressions that end with `$`.

There are six possible ways to write a single pattern:
.RS 2
.IP 1. 3
[!]{comma-separated-name-globs}
.IP 2. 3
[!]{{comma-separated-path-globs}}
.IP 3. 3
[!]/name-regular-expression/[iI]
.IP 4. 3
[!]//path-regular-expression//[iI]
.IP 5. 3
[!]<comma-separated-mime-type-globs>
.IP 6. 3
undecorated-pattern
.RE

First five forms can include leading exclamation mark that negates pattern
matching.

The last form is implicitly refers to one of others.  :highlight does not accept
undecorated form, while :filetype, :filextype, :fileviewer, :select, :unselect
and 'classify' treat it as list of name globs.

Path patterns receive absolute path of the file that includes its name
component as well.

To combine several patterns (AND them), make sure you're using one of the first
five forms and write patterns one after another, like this:
.EX
  <text/plain>{*.vifm}
.EE
Mind that if you make a mistake the whole string will be treated as the sixth
form.

:filetype, :filextype and :fileviewer commands accept comma-separated list of
patterns instead of a single pattern, thus effectively handling OR operation on
them:
.EX
  <text/plain>{*.vifm},<application/pdf>{*.pdf}
.EE
Forms that accept comma-separated lists of patterns also process them as
lists of alternatives.

.B Patterns with regular expressions

Regular expression patterns are case insensitive by default, see description
of commands, which might override default behaviour.

Flags of regular expressions mean the following:
  - "i" makes filter case insensitive;
  - "I" makes filter case sensitive.
They can be repeated multiple times, but the later one takes precedence (e.g.
"iiiI" is equivalent to "I" and "IiIi" is the same as "i").

There are no implicit `^` or `$`, so make sure to specify them explicitly if
the pattern should match the whole name or path.

.B Patterns with globs

"Globs" section below provides short overview of globs and some important points
that one needs to know about them.

.B Patterns with mime-types

Mime type matching is essentially globs matching applied to mime type of a file
instead of its name/path.  Note: mime types aren't detected on Windows.

.B Examples

Associate `evince` to PDF-files only inside `/home/user/downloads/` directory
(excluding its subdirectories):
.EX

  :filextype //^/home/user/downloads/[^/]*\.pdf$// evince %f

.EE
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Regular expressions
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
All regular expressions are modern/extended.  See `man 7 regex` for more
details on what's supported.

The following special sequences are additionally parsed:
 - `\\c` forces matching ignoring case of letters
 - `\\C` forces matching respecting case of letters

`\\c` and `\\C` have the highest priority in determining whether case is
matched or not and exist to override 'ignorecase', 'smartcase' and
`i`/`I` flags when necessary.

If multiple sequences are present, the one which appears later takes
precedence.

Note that unlike in Vim character classes are affected by settings and
sequences that control case sensitivity in regular expressions.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Globs
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Globs are always case insensitive as it makes sense in general case.

`*`, `?`, `[` and `]` are treated as special symbols in the pattern.  E.g.
.EX

  :filetype * less %c

.EE
matches all files.  One can use character classes for escaping, so
.EX

  :filetype [*] less %c

.EE
matches only one file name, the one which contains only asterisk symbol.

`*` means any number of any characters (possibly an empty substring), with one
exception: asterisk at the pattern beginning doesn't match dot in the first
position.  E.g.
.EX

  :fileviewer *.zip,*.jar zip \-sf %c

.EE
associates using of `zip` program to preview all files with `zip` or `jar`
extensions as listing of their content, but `.file.zip` won't be matched.

`?` means any character at this position.  E.g.
.EX

  :fileviewer ?.out file %c

.EE
calls `file` tool for all files which have exactly one character before their
extension (e.g. a.out, b.out).

Square brackets designate character class, which means that whole character
class matches against any of characters listed in it.  For example
.EX

  :fileviewer *.[ch] highlight \-O xterm256 \-s dante \-\-syntax c %c

.EE
makes vifm call `highlight` program to colorize source and header files in C
language for a 256-color terminal.  Equal command would be
.EX

  :fileviewer *.c,*.h highlight \-O xterm256 \-s dante \-\-syntax c %c

.EE

Inside square brackets `^` or `!` can be used for symbol class negation and
the `\-` symbol to set a range.  `^` and `!` should appear right after the
opening square bracket.  For example
.EX

  :filetype *.[!d]/ inspect_dir

.EE
associates `inspect_dir` as additional handler for all directories that have one
character extension unless it's "d" letter.  And
.EX

  :filetype [0-9].jpg sxiv

.EE
associates `sxiv` picture viewer only for JPEG-files that contain single digit
in their name.

If you need to include literal comma, which normally separates multiple
globs, double it.

The idea is that current directory can be made a temporary exception to regular
configuration of the view, until directory change.  Use :setlocal for that.
:setglobal changes view value not affecting settings until directory change.
:set applies changes immediately to all values.

.TP
.BI 'aproposprg'
type: string
.br
default: "apropos %a"
.br
Specifies format for an external command to be invoked by the :apropos command.
The format supports expanding of macros, specific for a particular *prg option,
and %% sequence for inserting percent sign literally.  This option should
include the %a macro to specify placement of arguments passed to the :apropos
command.  If the macro is not used, it will be implicitly added after a space to
the value of this option.
.TP
.BI 'autocd'
type: boolean
.br
default: false
.br
When enabled unknown command-line commands are interpreted as implicit
invocation of :cd with one argument and no escaping.  Tilde is
expanded, but not macros or environment variables.
.TP
.BI 'autochpos'
type: boolean
.br
default: true
.br
When disabled vifm will set cursor to the first line in the view after :cd and
:pushd commands instead of saved cursor position.  Disabling this will also
make vifm clear information about cursor position in the view history on :cd
and :pushd commands (and on startup if 'autochpos' is disabled in the vifmrc).
l key in the ":history ." and ":trashes" menus are treated like :cd command.
This option also affects marks so that navigating to a mark doesn't restore
cursor position.

When this option is enabled, more fine grained control over cursor position is
available via 'histcursor' option.
.TP
.BI "'columns' 'co'"
type: integer
.br
default: terminal width on startup
.br
Terminal width in characters.
.TP
.BI "'caseoptions'"
type: charset
.br
default: ""
.br
This option gives additional control over case sensitivity by allowing
overriding default behaviour to either always be case sensitive or
always be case insensitive.  Possible values form pairs of lower and
upper case letters that configure specific aspect of behaviour:
  p - always ignore case of paths during completion.
  P - always match case of paths during completion.
  g - always ignore case of characters for f/F/;/,.
  G - always match case of characters for f/F/;/,.

At most one item of each pair takes affect, if both or more are present, only
the last one matters.  When none of pair's elements are present, the behaviour
is default (depends on operating system for path completion and on values
of 'ignorecase' and 'smartcase' options for file navigation).
.TP
.BI "'cdpath' 'cd'"
type: string list
.br
default: value of $CDPATH with commas instead of colons
.br
Specifies locations to check on changing directory with relative path that
doesn't start with "./" or "../".  When non-empty, current directory is
examined after directories listed in the option.

This option doesn't affect completion of :cd command.

Example:
.EX

  set cdpath=~

.EE
This way ":cd bin" will switch to "~/bin" even if directory named "bin" exists
in current directory, while ":cd ./bin" command will ignore value of 'cdpath'.
.TP
.BI 'chaselinks'
type: boolean
.br
default: false
.br
When enabled path of view is always resolved to real path (with all symbolic
links expanded).
.TP
.BI 'classify'
type: string list
.br
default: ":dir:/"
.br
Specifies file name prefixes and suffixes depending on file type or name (mind
that directory names have an implicit trailing slash).  The format is either
of:
  - [{prefix}]:{filetype}:[{suffix}]
  - [{prefix}]::{pattern}::[{suffix}]
.br
Possible {pattern} forms are described in "Patterns" section above.

Priority rules:
  - file name patterns have priority over type patterns
  - file name patterns are matched in left-to-right order of their appearance \
in this option

Either {prefix} or {suffix} or both can be omitted (which is the default for
all unspecified file types), this means empty {prefix} and/or {suffix}.
{prefix} and {suffix} should consist of at most eight characters.  Elements
are separated by commas.  Neither prefixes nor suffixes are part of file names,
so they don't affect commands which operate on file names in any way.  Comma
(',') character can be inserted by doubling it.  List of file type names can be
found in the description of filetype() function.
.TP
.BI "'confirm' 'cf'"
type: set
.br
default: delete,permdelete
.br
Defines which operations require confirmation:
.br
 \- delete     \- moving files to trash (on d or :delete);
.br
 \- permdelete \- permanent deletion of files (on D or :delete! command or on
undo/redo operation).
.TP
.BI "'cpoptions' 'cpo'"
type: charset
.br
default: "fst"
.br
Contains a sequence of single-character flags.  Each flag enables behaviour of
older versions of vifm.  Flags:
.br
 \- f \- when included, running :filter command results in not inverted
(matching files are filtered out) and :filter! in inverted (matching files are
left) filter, when omitted, meaning of the exclamation mark changes to the
opposite;
.br
 \- s \- when included, yy, Y, dd and DD normal mode commands act
on selection if there is any, otherwise they operate on the current file;
when omitted, those commands always operate on the current file;
.br
 \- t \- when included, <tab> (thus <c-i>) behave as <space> and switches \
active pane, otherwise <tab> and <c-i> go forward in the view history.  It's
possible to make both <tab> and <c-i> to work as expected by setting up the
terminal to emit a custom sequence when <c-i> is pressed; see :histnext for
details.
.TP
.BI 'cvoptions'
type: set
.br
default:
.br
Specifies whether entering/leaving custom views triggers events that normally
happen on entering/leaving directories:
 \- autocmds    \- trigger autocommands on entering/leaving custom views;
 \- localopts   \- reset local options on entering/leaving custom views;
 \- localfilter \- reset local filter on entering/leaving custom views.
.TP
.BI 'deleteprg'
type: string
.br
default: ""
.br
Specifies program to run on files that are permanently removed.  When empty,
files are removed as usual, otherwise this command is invoked on each file by
appending its name.  If the command doesn't remove files, they will remain on
the file system.
.TP
.BI 'dirsize'
type: enumeration
.br
default: size
.br
Controls how size of directories is displayed in file views.  The following
values are possible:
 \- size   \- size of directory (i.e., size used to store list of files)
 \- nitems \- number of entries in the directory (excluding . and ..)

Size obtained via ga/gA overwrites this setting so seeing count of files and
occasionally size of directories is possible.
.TP
.BI 'dotdirs'
type: set
.br
default: nonrootparent,treeleafsparent
.br
Controls displaying of dot directories.  The following values are possible:
 \- rootparent      \- show "../" in root directory of file system
 \- nonrootparent   \- show "../" in non-root directories of file system
 \- treeleafsparent \- show "../" in empty directories of tree view

Note that empty directories always contain "../" entry regardless of value of
this option.  "../" disappears at the moment at least one file is created.
.TP
.BI 'dotfiles'
type: boolean
.br
default: false
.br
Whether dot files are shown in the view.  Can be controlled with z* bindings.
.TP
.BI 'fastrun'
type: boolean
.br
default: false
.br
With this option turned on you can run partially entered commands with
unambiguous beginning using :! (e.g. :!Te instead of :!Terminal or :!Te<tab>).
.TP
.BI "'fillchars' 'fcs'"
type: string list
.br
default: ""
.br
Sets characters used to fill borders.

  item         default    used for
  hborder:c    ''         middle horizontal border
  millersep:c  ''         separator of miller columns
  vborder:c    ' '        left, middle and right vertical borders

An empty string for millersep or vborder is equivalent to a space.

An empty string for hborder omits the horizontal border.

Example:

.EX
  set fillchars=vborder:".",hborder:"",millersep:"|"
.EE
.TP
.BI 'findprg'
type: string
.br
default: "find %s %a"
.br
Specifies format for an external command to be invoked by the :find
command.  The format supports expansion of macros specific for this particular
option and %% sequence for inserting percent sign literally.  The macros are:

  macro   value/meaning
   %s     literal arguments of :find or
          list of paths to search in

   %A     empty or
          literal arguments of :find
   %a     empty or
          literal arguments of :find or
          predicate followed by escaped arguments of :find
   %p     empty or
          literal arguments of :find or
          escaped arguments (parameters) of :find

   %u     redirect output to custom view instead of showing a menu
   %U     redirect output to unsorted custom view instead of showing a menu

Predicate in %a is "\-name" on *nix and "\-iname" on Windows.

If both %u and %U are specified, %U is chosen.

Some macros can be added implicitly:
 - if %s isn't present, it's appended
 - if neither of %a, %A and %p is present, %a is appended
 - if neither of %s, %a, %A and %p is present, %s and %a are appended in this \
order

The macros slightly change their meaning depending on format of :find's
arguments:
 - if the first argument points to an existing directory, %s is assigned all \
arguments while %a, %A and %p are left empty
 - otherwise:
    - %s is assigned a dot (".") meaning current directory or list of \
selected file names, if any
    - %a, %A and %p are assigned literal arguments when first argument starts \
with a dash ("-"), otherwise %a gets an escaped version of the arguments \
with a predicate and %p contains escaped version of the arguments

Starting with Windows Server 2003 a `where` command is available.  One can
configure vifm to use it in the following way:
.EX

    set findprg="where /R %s %A"

.EE
As the syntax of this command is rather limited, one can't use :find
command with selection of more than one item because the command ignores all
directory paths except for the last one.

When using find port on Windows, another option is to setup 'findprg' like
this:
.EX

    set findprg="find %s %a"

.EE
.TP
.BI 'followlinks'
type: boolean
.br
default: true
.br
Follow links on l or Enter.  That is navigate to destination file instead of
treating the link as if it were target file.  Doesn't affects links to
directories, which are always entered (use gf key for directories).
.TP
.BI 'fusehome'
type: string
.br
default: "($XDG_DATA_HOME/vifm | $VIFM)/fuse/"
.br
Directory to be used as a root dir for FUSE mounts.  Value of the option can
contain environment variables (in form "$envname"), which will be expanded
(prepend it with a slash to prevent expansion).  The value should expand to an
absolute path.

If you change this option, vifm won't remount anything.  It affects future
mounts only.  See "Automatic FUSE mounts" section below for more information.
.TP
.BI "'gdefault' 'gd'"
type: boolean
.br
default: false
.br
When on, 'g' flag is on for :substitute by default.
.TP
.BI 'grepprg'
type: string
.br
default: "grep \-n \-H \-I \-r %i %a %s"
.br
Specifies format for an external command to be invoked by the :grep command.
The format supports expanding of macros, specific for a particular *prg option,
and %% sequence for inserting percent sign literally.  This option should
include the %i macro to specify placement of "\-v" string when inversion of
results is requested, %a or %A macro to specify placement of arguments passed to
the :grep command and the %s macro to specify placement of list of files to
search in.  If some of the macros are not used, they will be implicitly added
after a space to the value of the 'grepprg' option in the following order: %i,
%a, %s.  Note that when neither %a nor %A are specified, it's %a which is added
implicitly.

Optional %u or %U macro could be used (if both specified %U is chosen) to force
redirection to custom or unsorted custom view respectively.

See 'findprg' option for description of difference between %a and %A.

Example of setup to use ack (http://beyondgrep.com/) instead of grep:
.EX

  set grepprg='ack \-H \-r %i %a %s'

.EE
or The Silver Searcher (https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher):
.EX

  set grepprg='ag \-\-line-numbers %i %a %s'

.EE

.TP
.BI 'histcursor'
type: set
.br
default: startup,dirmark,direnter
.br
Defines situations when cursor should be moved according to directory
history:
 \- startup  \- on loading file lists during startup
 \- dirmark  \- after navigating to a mark that doesn't specify file
 \- direnter \- on opening directory from a file list

This option has no effect when 'autochpos' is disabled.

Note that the list is not exhaustive and there are other situations when cursor
is positioned automatically.
.TP
.BI "'history' 'hi'"
type: integer
.br
default: 15
.br
Maximum number of stored items in all histories.
.TP
.BI vifm-'hloptions'
type: string list
.br
default: "filehi:onerow"
.br
Configures behaviour of highlighting.

  item        default
  filehi:str  onerow

The "filehi" item specifies which columns of the view get colored according to
file type and its name:
 - path    - highlight columns that display file path, name, root or extension
 - onerow  - same as "path" and also highlight all columns of the current line
 - allrows - highlight all columns of each row
.TP
.BI "'hlsearch' 'hls'"
type: boolean
.br
default: true
.br
Automatically select files that are search matches.
.TP
.BI 'iec'
type: boolean
.br
default: false
.br
Use KiB, MiB, ... suffixes instead of K, M, ... when printing size in
human-friendly format.
.TP
.BI "'ignorecase' 'ic'"
type: boolean
.br
default: false
.br
Ignore case in search patterns (:substitute, / and ? commands), local filter
(but not the rest of filters) and other things detailed in the description
of 'caseoptions'.
.TP
.BI "'incsearch' 'is'"
type: boolean
.br
default: false
.br
When this option is set, search and view update for local filter is be
performed starting from initial cursor position each time search pattern is
changed.
.TP
.BI 'iooptions'
type: set
.br
default: datasync
.br
Controls details of file operations.  The following values are available:
 \- datasync \- periodically synchronize writes on copying files when\
 'syscalls' is set.
              (This makes copying last as long as it takes to actually write
              data to the medium, which is slower than you might expect;
              however, this also prevents system hanging due to filling memory
              with file-system cache.)
 \- fastfilecloning \- perform fast file cloning (copy-on-write), when \
available (available on Linux and btrfs file system).
.TP
.BI "'laststatus' 'ls'"
type: boolean
.br
default: true
.br
Controls if status bar is visible.
.TP
.BI 'lines'
type: integer
.br
default: terminal height on startup
.br
Terminal height in lines.
.TP
.BI 'locateprg'
type: string
.br
default: "locate %a"
.br
Specifies format for an external command to be invoked by the :locate command.
The format supports expanding of macros, specific for a particular *prg option,
and %% sequence for inserting percent sign literally.  This option should
include the %a macro to specify placement of arguments passed to the :locate
command.  If the macro is not used, it will be implicitly added after a space to
the value of this option.

Optional %u or %U macro could be used (if both specified %U is chosen) to force
redirection to custom or unsorted custom view respectively.
.TP
.BI 'mediaprg'
type: string
.br
default: path to bundled script that supports udevil, udisks and udisks2
         (using udisks2 requires python with dbus module installed)
         OS X: path points to a python script that uses diskutil
.br
{only for *nix}
.br
Specifies command to be used to manage media devices.  Used by :media command.

The command can be passed the following parameters:
 - list           -- list media
 - mount {device} -- mount a device
 - unmount {path} -- unmount given mount point

The output of `list` subcommand is parsed in search of lines that start with
one of the following prefixes:
 - device=      - specifies device path (e.g., "/dev/sde")
 - label=       - specifies optional device label (e.g., "Memory card")
 - info=        - specifies arbitrary text to display next to device (by
                  default "[label]" is used, if label is provided)
 - mount-point= - specifies a mount point (can be absent or appear more than
once)

All other lines are ignored.  Each `device=` starts a new section describing a
device which should include two other possible prefixes.

`list` subcommand is assumed to always succeed, while exit code of `mount` and
`unmount` is taken into account to determine whether operation was performed
successfully.
.TP
.BI 'lsoptions'
type: string list
.br
default: ""
.br
scope: local
.br

Configures ls-like view.

  item          used for
  columncount   fixed number of columns to display or 0
  transposed    filling view grid by columns rather than by lines

.TP
.BI 'lsview'
type: boolean
.br
default: false
.br
scope: local
.br
When this option is set, directory view will be displayed in multiple columns
with file names similar to output of `ls \-x` command.  See "ls-like view"
section below for format description.  This option has no effect if 'millerview'
is on.
.TP
.BI 'milleroptions'
type: string list
.br
default: "lsize:1,csize:1,rsize:1,rpreview:dirs"
.br
scope: local
.br

Configures miller view.

  item          default  used for
  lsize:num     0        left column
  csize:num     1        center column (can't be disabled)
  rsize:num     0        right column
  rpreview:str  dirs     right column

*size specifies ratios of columns.  Each ratio is in the range from
0 to 100 and values are adjusted to fit the limits.  Zero disables a
column, but central (main) column can't be disabled.

rpreview specifies what file-system objects should be previewed in the right
column and takes three values: dirs (only directories), files (only files) or
all.  Neither value enables preview of parent directory ("..").

Example of two-column mode which is useful in combination with :view command:
.EX

  set milleroptions=lsize:1,csize:2
.EE

.TP
.BI 'millerview'
type: boolean
.br
default: false
.br
scope: local
.br
When this option is set, directory view will be displayed in multiple
cascading columns.  Ignores 'lsview'.
.TP
.BI 'mintimeoutlen'
type: integer
.br
default: 150
.br
The fracture of 'timeoutlen' in milliseconds that is waited between subsequent
input polls, which affects various asynchronous operations (detecting changes
made by external applications, monitoring background jobs, redrawing UI).  There
are no strict guarantees, however the higher this value is, the less is CPU load
in idle mode.
.TP
.BI "'mouse'"
type: charset
.br
default: ""
.br

Contains a sequence of single-character flags:
 - a - all supported modes (a shorthand for all the rest and future additions)
 - c - command-line mode (includes navigation mode)
 - m - menu mode
 - n - normal mode
 - q - view mode
 - v - visual mode
.TP
.BI 'navoptions'
type: string list
.br
default: "open:dirs"
.br

Configures behaviour of navigation mode.

  item      default
  open:str  dirs

The "open" item specifies what file-system objects should be opened on
Enter and can take two values: dirs (only directories) or all.
.TP
.BI "'number' 'nu'"
type: boolean
.br
default: false
.br
scope: local
.br
Print line number in front of each file name when 'lsview' option is turned off.
Use 'numberwidth' to control width of line number.  Also see 'relativenumber'.
.TP
.BI "'numberwidth' 'nuw'"
type: integer

.br
Minimal number of characters for line number field.
.TP
.BI "'previewoptions'"
type: string list
.br
default: "graphicsdelay:50000"
.br

Tweaks how previewing is done (in quick view, miller view's column and
view mode).

  item               default  meaning
  graphicsdelay:num  0        delay before drawing graphics (microseconds)
  hardgraphicsclear  unset    redraw screen to get rid of graphics
  maxtreedepth:num   0        max number of levels in preview tree
  toptreestats       unset    show file counts before the tree

graphicsdelay is needed if terminal requires some timeout before it can
draw graphics (otherwise it gets lost).

hardgraphicsclear seems to be necessary to get rid of sixel graphics in some
terminals, where it otherwise lingers.  This can cause flicker on the screen
due to erasure followed by redrawing.

0 for maxtreedepth means "unlimited", 1 will only show selected directory, 2
adds its children, and so forth.

Default value is used when item is missing from the option.
.TP
.BI "'previewprg'"
type: string
.br
default: ""
.br
scope: local
.br

External command to be used instead of preview programs configured via

.br
default: false
.br
scope: local
.br
Print relative line number in front of each file name when 'lsview' option is

.TP
.BI "'rulerformat' 'ruf'"
type: string
.br
default: "%l/%S "
.br
Determines the content of the ruler.  Its minimal width is 13 characters and
it's right aligned.  Following macros are supported:
.br
 %=  \- separation point between left and right aligned halves of the line
.br
 %l  \- file number
.br
 %L  \- total number of files in view (including filtered out ones)
.br
 %x  \- number of files excluded by filters
.br
 %0\- \- old name for %x macro
.br
 %P  \- percentage through file list (All, Top, xx% or Bot), always 3 in length
.br
 %S  \- number of displayed files
.br
 %=  \- separation point between left and right align items
.br
 %%  \- literal percent sign
.br
 %[  \- designates beginning of an optional block
.br
 %]  \- designates end of an optional block
.br

Percent sign can be followed by optional minimum field width.  Add '\-' before
minimum field width if you want field to be right aligned.

Optional blocks are ignored unless at least one macro inside of them is
expanded to a non-empty value.

Example:

.EX
  set rulerformat='%2l-%S%[ +%x%]'
.EE
.TP
.BI 'runexec'
type: boolean
.br
default: false
.br
Run executable file on Enter, l or Right Arrow key.  Behaviour of the last two
depends on the value of the 'lsview' option.
.TP
.BI "'scrollbind' 'scb'"
type: boolean
.br
default: false
.br
When this option is set, vifm will try to keep difference of scrolling positions
of two windows constant.
.TP
.BI "'scrolloff' 'so'"
type: integer
.br
default: 0
.br
Minimal number of screen lines to keep above and below the cursor.  If you
want cursor line to always be in the middle of the view (except at the
beginning or end of the file list), set this option to some large value
(e.g. 999).
.TP
.BI "'sessionoptions' 'ssop'"
sessionoptions ssop
.br
type: set
.br
default: tui,state,tabs,savedirs,dhistory
.br
An equivalent of 'vifminfo' for sessions, uses the same values.  When
both options include the same value, data from session file has higher
priority (data from vifminfo isn't necessarily completely discarded,
instead it's merged with the state of a session the same way state of
multiple instances is merged on exit).
.TP
.BI "'shell' 'sh'"
type: string
.br
default: $SHELL or "/bin/sh" or "cmd" (on MS-Windows)
.br
Full path to the shell to use to run external commands.  On *nix a shell
argument can be supplied.
.TP
.BI "'shellcmdflag' 'shcf'"
type: string
.br
default: "\-c" or "/C" (for cmd.exe on MS-Windows)
.br
Command-line option used to pass a command to 'shell'.  It's used in contexts
where command comes from the user.

Note that using this option to force interactive mode of the shell is most
likely a BAD IDEA.  In general interactive host and interactive child shell
can't share the same terminal session.  You can't even run such a shell in
background.  Consider writing a wrapper for your shell that preloads aliases
and commands without making the shell interactive and ending up using it in
a way it was not meant to be used.

Note that this option is ignored when 'shell' is set to PowerShell due
to the internal use of `\-encodedCommand`.
.TP
.BI "'shortmess' 'shm'"
type: charset
.br
default: "p"
.br
Contains a sequence of single-character flags.  Each flag enables shortening

.BI "'showtabline' 'stal'"
type: enumeration
.br
default: multiple
.br
Specifies when tab line should be displayed.  Possible values:
 - never    - never display tab line
 - multiple - show tab line only when there are at least two tabs
 - always   - display tab line always

Alternatively 0, 1 and 2 Vim-like values  are also accepted and correspond to
"never", "multiple" and "always" respectively.

.BI 'sizefmt'
type: string list
.br
default: "units:iec"
.br
Configures the way size is formatted in human-friendly way.

    item          value         meaning
    units:        iec           Use 1024 byte units (K or KiB, etc.).
                                See 'iec' option.
                  si            Use 1000 byte units (KB, etc.).
    precision:    i > 0         How many fraction digits to consider.
                  {not set}     Precision of 1 for integer part < 10,
                                0 otherwise (provides old behaviour).
    space         {present}     Insert space before unit symbols.
                                This is the default.
    nospace       {present}     Do not insert space before unit symbols.

Numbers are rounded from zero.  Trailing zeros are dropped.

Example:
.EX

  set sizefmt=units:iec,precision:2,nospace
.EE

.TP
.BI 'slowfs'
type: string list
.br
default: ""
.br
only for *nix
.br
A list of mounter fs name beginnings (first column in /etc/mtab or
/proc/mounts) or paths prefixes for fs/directories that work too slow for
you.  This option can be used to stop vifm from making some requests to
particular kinds of file systems that can slow down file browsing.
Currently this means don't check if directory has changed, skip check if
target of symbolic links exists, assume that link target located on slow fs
to be a directory (allows entering directories and navigating to files via gf).
If you set the option to "*", it means all the systems are considered slow
(useful for cygwin, where all the checks might render vifm very slow if there
are network mounts).

Example for autofs root /mnt/autofs:
.EX

  set slowfs+=/mnt/autofs
.EE
.TP
.BI "'smartcase' 'scs'"
type: boolean
.br
default: false
.br
Overrides the ignorecase option if a pattern contains at least one
upper case character.  Only used when 'ignorecase' option is enabled.
.TP
.BI 'sort'
type: string list
.br
default: +name on *nix and +iname on Windows
.br
scope: local
.br
Sets list of sorting keys (first item is primary key, second is secondary key,
etc.):
   [+\-]ext     \- extension of files and directories
   [+\-]fileext \- extension of files only
   [+\-]name    \- name (including extension)
   [+\-]iname   \- name (including extension, ignores case)
   [+\-]type    \- file type (dir/reg/exe/link/char/block/sock/fifo)
   [+\-]dir     \- directory grouping (directory < file)
   [+\-]gid     \- group id (*nix only)
   [+\-]gname   \- group name (*nix only)
   [+\-]mode    \- file type derived from its mode (*nix only)
   [+\-]perms   \- permissions string (*nix only)
   [+\-]uid     \- owner id (*nix only)
   [+\-]uname   \- owner name (*nix only)
   [+\-]nlinks  \- number of hard links (*nix only)
   [+\-]inode   \- inode number (*nix only)
   [+\-]size    \- size
   [+\-]nitems  \- number of items in a directory (zero for files)
   [+\-]groups  \- groups extracted via regexps from 'sortgroups'
   [+\-]target  \- symbolic link target (empty for other file types)
   [+\-]atime   \- time accessed (e.g., read, executed)
   [+\-]ctime   \- time changed (changes in metadata, like mode)
   [+\-]mtime   \- time modified (when file contents is changed)

Note: look for st_atime, st_ctime and st_mtime in "man 2 stat" for more
information on time keys.

\(aq+\(aq means ascending sort for this key, and '\-' means descending sort.

"dir" key is somewhat similar in this regard but it's added implicitly:
when "dir" is not specified, sorting behaves as if it was the first key in
the list.  That's why if one wants sorting algorithm to mix directories and
files, "dir" should be appended to sorting option, for example like this:
.EX

  set sort+=dir

.EE
or
.EX

  set sort=-size,dir
.EE

Value of the option is checked to include dir key and default sorting
key (name on *nix, iname on Windows).  Here is what happens if one of them is
missing:
.RS
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
type key is added at the beginning;
.IP \- 2
default key is added at the end;

.br
default: false
.br
scope: local
.br
Natural sort of (version) numbers within text.
.TP
.BI 'sortgroups'
type: string
.br
default: ""
.br
scope: local
.br
Sets comma-separated list of regular expressions for group type of sorting.
Double the comma to insert it literally.

The regular expressions are used to extract substrings of file names to serve
as keys for sorting.  It is essentially a way to ignore uninteresting parts
of file names during sorting by name.

Each expression should contain at least one group or its value will be
considered to be always empty.  Also, only the first match of regular
expression is processed.

The first group divides list of files into sub-groups, each of which is then
sorted by substrings extracted using second regular expression and so on
recursively.

Example:
.EX
  set sortgroups=-(todo|done).*
.EE
this would group files with "\-done" in their names and files with "\-todo"
separately.  On ascending sorting, group containing "\-done" would appear
before the other one.
.TP
.BI 'sortorder'
type: enumeration
.br
default: ascending
.br
Sets sort order for primary key: ascending, descending.
.TP
.BI "'statusline' 'stl'"
type: string

default: ""
.br
Determines the content of the status line (the line right above command-line).
Empty string means use same format like in previous versions.  Following macros
are supported:
.RS
.IP \- 2
%N \- line break (increases height of the status line accordingly), ignores
%[ %] blocks
.IP \- 2
%t \- file name (considering value of the 'classify' option)
.IP \- 2
%T - symbolic link target (empty for other filetypes)
.IP \- 2
%f - file name relative to current directory (considers 'classify')
.IP \- 2
%A \- file attributes (permissions on *nix or properties on Windows)
.IP \- 2
%o \- file permissions in octal form on *nix (nothing on Windows)
.IP \- 2
%u \- user name or uid (if it cannot be resolved)
.IP \- 2
%g \- group name or gid (if it cannot be resolved)
.IP \- 2
%s \- file size in human readable format
.IP \- 2
%E \- size of selected files in human readable format, same as %s when no
files are selected, except that it will never show size of ../ in visual mode,
since it cannot be selected
.IP \- 2
%d \- file modification date (uses 'timefmt' option)
.IP \- 2
%D \- path of the other pane for single-pane layout
.IP \- 2
%a - amount of free space available on current FS
.IP \- 2
%c - size of current FS
.IP \- 2
%z - short tips/tricks/hints that chosen randomly after one minute period

%{<expr>} - evaluate arbitrary vifm expression '<expr>', e.g. '&sort' or
`expand('%d')`; a raw `}` can be inserted as `\\}` (mind that
the slash doesn't need to be doubled to be inserted literally)
.IP \- 2
%* - resets or applies one of User1..User20 highlight groups; reset happens
when width field is 0 or not specified, one of the groups gets picked
when width field is in the range from 1 to 20

operations which use them.
.TP
.BI 'syscalls'
type: boolean

When enabled, title of the terminal or terminal multiplexer's window is
updated according to current location.  Because not all terminals support
setting title, this works only if `$TERM` value matches one of the following
conditions:

.BI 'trash'
type: boolean
.br
default: true
.br
Use trash directory.  See "Trash directory" section below.

.BI 'trashdir'
type: string
.br
default:
  on *nix:
    "%r/.vifm-Trash-%u,$XDG_DATA_HOME/vifm/Trash,%r/.vifm-Trash"
    or
    "%r/.vifm-Trash-%u,$VIFM/Trash,%r/.vifm-Trash"
  on Windows:
    "%r/.vifm-Trash,$XDG_DATA_HOME/vifm/Trash"
    or
    "%r/.vifm-Trash,$VIFM/vifm/Trash"
.br
List of trash directory path specifications, separated with commas.
Each list item either defines an absolute path to trash directory or a path
relative to a mount point root when list element starts with "%r/".
Value of the option can contain environment variables (of form "$envname"),
which will be expanded (prepend $ with a slash to prevent expansion).
Environment variables are expanded when the option is set.

On *nix, if element ends with "%u", the mark is replaced with real user ID and
permissions are set so that only that owner is able to use it.
.br
.B Note
that even this setup is not completely secure when combined with "%r/" and it's
overall safer to keep files in home directory, but that implies cost of copying
files between partitions.

When new file gets cut (deleted) vifm traverses each element of the option in
the order of their appearance and uses first trash directory that it was able
to create or that is already writable.

Default value tries to use trash directory per mount point and falls back to
trash common trash directory on failure.

Will attempt to create the directory if it does not exist.  See
"Trash directory" section below.
.TP
.BI "'tuioptions' 'to'"
type: charset
.br
default: "psv"
.br
Each flag configures some aspect of TUI appearance.  The flags are:
.br
p \- when included:
    * file list inside a pane gets additional single character padding on left \
and right sides;
    * quick view and view mode get single character padding.
.br
s \- when included, left and right borders (side borders, hence "s" character)
are visible.
.br
u \- use Unicode characters in the TUI (Unicode ellipsis instead of "...").
.br
v \- vary width of vertical middle border to equalize view sizes.

Each pane title contains the path of the listed directory.  If too large, the
path is truncated on the left for the active pane and on the right for the other
pane.  This can be modified with:

l \- truncation is always on the left.
.br
r \- truncation is always on the right.

.BI "'undolevels' 'ul'"
type: integer
.br
default: 100

Maximum number of changes that can be undone.  Note that here single file
operation is used as a unit, not operation, i.e. deletion of 101 files will
exceed default limit.
.TP
.BI 'vicmd'
type: string
.br
default: "vim"
.br
Command used to edit files in various contexts.  Ampersand sign at the end
(regardless whether it's preceded by space or not) means backgrounding of
command.

Background flag is ignored in certain context where vifm waits for the editor
to finish.  Such contexts include any command that spawns editor to change
list of file names or a command, with :rename being one example.
`\-f` is also appended to prevent forking in such cases, so the command needs
to handle the flag.

Additionally `+{num}` and `+'call cursor()'` arguments are used to position
cursor when location is known.
.TP
.BI 'viewcolumns'

.BI 'wordchars'
type: string list
.br
default: "1-8,14-31,33-255" (that is all non-whitespace characters)
.br
Specifies which characters in command-line mode should be considered as part
of a word.  Value of the option is comma-separated list of ranges.  If both
endpoints of a range match, single endpoint is enough (e.g. "a" = "a-a").
Both endpoints are inclusive.  There are two accepted forms: character
representing itself or number encoding character according to ASCII table.
In case of ambiguous characters (dash, comma, digit) use numeric form.
Accepted characters are in the range from 0 to 255.  Any Unicode character
with code greater than 255 is considered to be part of a word.

The option affects Alt-D, Alt-B and Alt-F, but not Ctrl-W.  This is
intentionally to allow two use cases:

 \- Moving by WORDS and deletion by words.
 \- Moving by words and deletion by WORDS.

To get the latter use the following mapping:
.EX

  cnoremap <c-w> <a-b><a-d>

.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Mappings
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A user mapping like `nnoremap lhs rhs` defines a substitution of the
left-hand-side (LHS) with the right-hand-side (RHS) in the input stream.  A
regular mapping (without "nore" in :command's name) expands recognized
sequences in the RHS, while "*noremap" mapping always interprets RHS as if no
user mappings were defined and each key has its builtin meaning.  In most cases
you want to use noremap variant and if your RHS includes LHS, only noremap
variant will work because recursion in a mapping is not allowed.

In order to define a mapping determine in which mode you want to activate it
and use an appropriate "*noremap" :command (e.g., :nnoremap for a
normal mode mapping).  RHS doesn't have to limit itself to the mode in which
the mapping was started and can span multiple modes.

.B Map arguments

LHS of mappings can be preceded by arguments which take the form of special
sequences:
.TP
.BI <silent>
Postpone UI updates until RHS is completely processed.
.TP
.BI <wait>
In case of builtin mapping causing conflict for a user-defined mapping
(e.g., `t` builtin to a partially typed `ta` user-defined mapping), ignore
the builtin mapping and wait for input indefinitely as opposed to
default behaviour of triggering the builtin mapping after a delay defined
by 'timeoutlen'.  Example:

.EX
  nnoremap <wait> tw :set wrap!<cr>
  nnoremap <wait> tn :set number!<cr>
  nnoremap <wait> tr :set relativenumber!<cr>
.EE
.LP

.B Special sequences

Since it's not easy to enter special characters there are several special
sequences that can be used in place of them.  They are:
.TP
.BI <cr>
Enter key.
.TP
.BI <esc>
Escape key.
.TP
.BI <space>
Space key.
.TP
.BI <lt>
Less-than character (<).
.TP
.BI <nop>
provides a way to disable a mapping (by mapping it to <nop>).
.TP
.BI <bs>
Backspace key (see key conflict description below).
.TP
.BI "<tab> <s-tab>"
Tabulation and Shift+Tabulation keys.
.TP
.BI "<home> <end>"
Home/End.
.TP
.BI "<left> <right> <up> <down>"
Arrow keys.
.TP
.BI "<pageup> <pagedown>"
PageUp/PageDown.
.TP
.BI "<del> <delete>"
Delete key.  <del> and <delete> mean different codes, but <delete> is more
common.
.TP
.BI "<insert>"
Insert key.

Note that whether and how functional keys work might depend on the terminal

Note that due to the way terminals process their input, several keyboard keys
might be mapped to single key code, for example:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
<cr> and <c-m>;
.IP \- 2
<tab> and <c-i>;
.IP \- 2
<c-h> and <bs> and <del>;
.IP \- 2
etc.
.RE

Most of the time they are defined consistently and don't cause surprises, but
<c-h> and <bs> are treated differently in different environments (although they
match each other all the time), that's why they correspond to different keys
in vifm.  As a consequence, if you map <c-h> or <bs> be sure to repeat the
mapping with the other one so that it works in all environments.
Alternatively, provide your mapping in one form and add one of the following:

.EX
  " if mappings with <c-h> in the LHS work
  map <c-h> <bs>
  " if mappings with <bs> in the LHS work
  map <bs> <c-h>
.EE

Also sometimes neither of them might work and it's <del> key which corresponds
to your backspace (don't mind the name).

.B Whitespace

vifm removes whitespace characters at the beginning and end of commands.
That's why you may want to use <space> at the end of rhs in mappings.  For
example:

.EX
  cmap <f1> man<space>
.EE

will put "man " in line when you hit the <f1> key in the command line mode.

".." indicates that the operations in this level can be concatenated.

expr1
.br
-----
.br
expr2 || expr2

Arguments are converted to numbers before evaluation.

Result is non-zero if at least one of arguments is non-zero.

It's right associative and with short-circuiting, so sub-expressions are
evaluated from left to right until result of whole expression is determined
(i.e., until first non-zero) or end of the expression.

expr2
.br
-----
.br
expr3 && expr3

Arguments are converted to numbers before evaluation.

Result is non-zero only if both arguments are non-zero.

It's right associative and with short-circuiting, so sub-expressions are
evaluated from left to right until result of whole expression is determined
(i.e., until first zero) or end of the expression.

expr3
.br
-----
.br
expr4 {cmp} expr4

Compare two expr4 expressions, resulting in a 0 if it evaluates to false or 1
if it evaluates to true.

equal                   ==
.br
not equal               !=

greater than            >
.br
greater than or equal   >=
.br
smaller than            <

  1 + '2'            == 3
.EE

expr5

  'a' . 'b'           == 'ab'
  'aaa' . '' . 'c'    == 'aaac'
.EE

expr6

For '\-' the sign of the number is changed.
.br
For '+' the number is unchanged.
.br
For '!' non-zero becomes zero, zero becomes one.

A String will be converted to a Number first.

These operations can be repeated and mixed.  Examples:

.EX
   \-\-9                == 9
  \-\-\-9                == \-9

"string"             string constant

Note that double quotes are used.

A string constant accepts these special characters:
.br
  \\b      backspace <bs>
.br
  \\e      escape <esc>
.br
  \\n      newline
.br
  \\r      return <cr>
.br
  \\t      tab <tab>
.br
  \\\\      backslash
.br
  \\"      double quote
.br

  "Hi,\\nthere!"
.EE

literal-string
.br
--------------
.br
\(aqstring\(aq             string constant

Note that single quotes are used.

This string is taken as it is.  No backslashes are removed or have a special
meaning.  The only exception is that two quotes stand for one quote.

Examples:

.EX
  'All\\slashes\\are\\saved.'
  'This string contains doubled single quotes ''here'''
.EE

option
.br
------
.br
&option               option value (local one is preferred, if exists)
&g:option             global option value
&l:option             local option value

Examples:

.EX
  echo 'Terminal size: '.&columns.'x'.&lines
  if &columns > 100
.EE

Any valid option name can be used here (note that "all" in ":set all" is a
pseudo option).  See ":set options" section above.

environment variable
.br
--------------------
.br
$VAR                  environment variable

The String value of any environment variable.  When it is not defined, the
result is an empty string.

Examples:

.EX
  'This is my $PATH env: ' . $PATH
  'vifmrc at ' . $MYVIFMRC . ' is used.'
.EE

global variable
.br
---------------
.br
g:var                 global variable

A typed storage of data for use in scripting.  Can be created/removed
dynamically (via :let and :unlet) and used in expressions.

builtin variable
.br
----------------
.br
v:var                 builtin variable

Information exposed by vifm for use in scripting.  Such variables are
predefined and read-only, but not necessarily constant.

.B "v:count"
.br
  count passed to : command, 0 by default.  Can be used in mappings to pass\
the count to a different command.
.br
.B "v:count1"
.br
  same as v:count, but 1 by default.
.br
.B "v:jobcount"
.br
  number of active jobs (as can be seen in the :jobs menu).
.br
.B "v:session"
.br
  name of the current session or empty string.
.br
.B "v:servername"
.br
  See below.
.br
.B "v:version"
.br
  version of the application as an integer.  Version `x.y.z` becomes number
`x*100*100 + y*100 + z`, examples:
   - v0.14 (that is v0.14.0) is 1400 (leading zeroes omitted)
   - v1.0.2 is 10002
  Release candidates aren't real releases, they report the number of a
corresponding release.
.br

function call
.br
-------------
.br
function(expr1, ...)  function call

See "Functions" section below.

Examples:

.EX
  "'" . filetype('.') . "'"
  filetype('.') == 'reg'
.EE

expression nesting
.br
------------------
.br
(expr1)               nested expression

Groups any other expression of arbitrary complexity enforcing order in which
operators are applied.

.BI chooseopt({opt})

Retrieves values of options related to file choosing.  {opt} can be one of:
    files      returns argument of \-\-choose-files or empty string
    dir        returns argument of \-\-choose-dir or empty string
    cmd        returns argument of \-\-on-choose or empty string
    delimiter  returns argument of \-\-delimiter or the default one (\\n)

.BI escape({string}, {chars})

Escapes all occurrences of {chars} in the {string} by prepending slash (`\`) to
them.  Note that the slash itself is not escaped unless it appears in {chars}.

.BI executable({expr})

If {expr} is absolute or relative path, checks whether path destination exists
and refers to an executable, otherwise checks whether command named {expr} is
present in directories listed in $PATH.  Checks for various executable
extensions on Windows.  Returns boolean value describing result of the check.

Example:

.EX
  " use custom default viewer script if it's available and installed
  " in predefined system directory, otherwise try to find it elsewhere
  if executable('/usr/local/bin/defviewer')
      fileview * /usr/local/bin/defviewer %c
  else
      if executable('defviewer')
          fileview * defviewer %c
      endif
  endif
.EE

.BI expand({expr})

Expands environment variables and macros in {expr} (in this order).  Returns
a string.  See "Command macros" section above.
.br

Examples:

.EX
  " percent sign
  :echo expand('%%')
  " the last part of directory name of the other pane
  :echo expand('%D:t')
  " $PATH environment variable (same as `:echo $PATH`)
  :echo expand('$PATH')
  " full path to the current file with backslashes
  :echo expand('%c:p:gs!/!\\!')
.EE

.BI "extcached({cache}, {path}, {extcmd})"

Caches value of {extcmd} external command automatically updating it as
necessary based on monitoring change date of a {path}.  The cache is
invalidated when file or its meta-data is updated.  A single path can have
multiple caches associated with it.

{path} value is normalized, but symbolic links in it aren't resolved.

Example:

.EX
  " display number and size of blocks actually used by a file or directory
  set statusline+=" Uses: %{ extcached('uses',
                                     \\ expand('%c'),
                                     \\ expand('stat \-\-format=%%bx%%B %c')) }"
.EE

.BI filereadable({path})

Checks whether {path} exists and refers to a non-directory entry and its
permissions allow reading.  Returns boolean value describing result of the
check.

.BI "filetype({file} [, {resolve}])"

Checks type of a view's entry or of a file specified by its path.

Parameter {file} can be of the following forms:
 \- '.' to get type of file under the cursor in the active pane
 \- numerical value base 1 to get type of file on specified line number (only
\if there are no characters other than "+-0123456789")
 \- a path (prepend "./" to force interpretation of a number or '.' as a path)

Optional parameter {resolve} is treated as a boolean and specifies whether
symbolic links should be resolved.

The result is a string, which represents file type and is one of the list:
    exe     executables
    reg     regular files
    link    symbolic links
    broken  broken symbolic links (appears only when resolving)
    dir     directories
    char    character devices
    block   block devices
    fifo    pipes
    sock    *nix domain sockets
    ?       unknown file type (should not normally happen) or
            non-file (pseudo-entries in compare view)

The result can also be an empty string in case of invalid argument.

.BI fnameescape({expr})

Escapes parameter to make it suitable for use as an argument of a :command.
List of escaped characters includes %, which is doubled.

Usage example:

.EX
  " navigate to most recently modified file in current directory
  execute 'goto' fnameescape(system('ls \-t | head \-1'))
.EE

.BI getpanetype()

Retrieves string describing type of current pane.  Possible return values:
    regular      regular file listing of some directory
    custom       custom file list (%u)
    very-custom  very custom file list (%U)
    tree         tree view
    compare      compare view

.BI has({property})

Allows examining internal parameters from scripts to e.g. figure out
environment in which application is running.  Returns 1 if property is
true/present, otherwise 0 is returned.  Currently the following properties
are supported (anything else will yield 0):
    unix  runs in *nix-like environment (including Cygwin)
    win   runs on Windows
    #*    whether particular Lua handler exists
.br

Usage example:

.EX
  " skip user/group on Windows
  if !has('win')
      let $RIGHTS = '%10u:%-7g '
  endif

  execute 'set' 'statusline="  %t%= %A '.$RIGHTS.'%15E %20d  "'
.EE

.BI "input({prompt} [, {initial} [, {completion}]])"

Creates a command-line prompt to obtain user's input.  Initial value can
be supplied as an optional second parameter, otherwise empty string is used.

Optional third parameter specifies kind of completion, which can be one of:
    dir   paths to directories
    file  paths to files and directories
    ""    (empty string, default) no completion

Note that behaviour differs from Vim where executing a mapping like
.EX
  nnoremap j :echo input('text: ')<cr>input
.EE
leaves you in a prompt mode with "input" typed in.  Vifm will wait for leaving
the prompt and then continue executing the mapping.

Usage example:

.EX
  nnoremap ,m : let $DIR_NAME = input('mkdir: ', '', 'dir')
             \\| if $DIR_NAME != ''
             \\|     execute 'mkdir' fnameescape($DIR_NAME)
             \\| endif<cr>
.EE

.BI layoutis({type})

Checks whether current interface layout is {type} or not, where {type} can be:
    only    single-pane mode
    split   double-pane mode (either vertical or horizontal split)
    vsplit  vertical split (left and right panes)
    hsplit  horizontal split (top and bottom panes)
.br

Usage example:

.EX
  " automatically split vertically before enabling preview
  :nnoremap w :if layoutis('only') | vsplit | endif | view!<cr>
.EE

.BI paneisat({loc})

Checks whether position of active pane in current layout matches one of the
following locations:
    top     pane reaches top border
    bottom  pane reaches bottom border
    left    pane reaches left border
    right   pane reaches right border
.br

.BI selected()

Retrieves number of files selected in the active pane.

.BI system({command})

Runs the command in shell and returns its output (joined standard output and
standard error streams).  All trailing newline characters are stripped to
allow easy appending to command output.  Ctrl-C should interrupt the command.

Use this function to consume output of external commands that don't require
user interaction and term() for interactive commands that make use of terminal
and are capable of handling stream redirection.

Usage example:

.EX
  " command to enter .git/ directory of git-repository (when ran inside one)
  command! cdgit :execute 'cd' fnameescape(system('git rev-parse \-\-git-dir'))
.EE

.BI tabpagenr([{arg}])

When called without arguments returns number of current tab page base one.

When called with "$" as an argument returns number of the last tab page base
one, which is the same as number of tabs.

.BI term({command})

Same as system() function, but user interface is shutdown during the execution
of the command, which makes sure that external interactive applications won't
affect the way terminal is used by vifm.

Usage example:

.EX
  " command to change directory by picking it via fzf
  command! fzfcd :execute 'cd'
                        \\ fnameescape(term('find \-type d | fzf 2> /dev/tty'))
.EE
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Menus and dialogs
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
When navigating to some path from a menu there is a difference in the end
location depending on whether the path has a trailing slash.  Files normally
don't have trailing slashes so "file/" won't work.  In case of directories
there are two options: navigate to a directory or inside of it.  To allow both
use cases, the first action is taken for "dir" and the second one for "dir/".

.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Menus history
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Menus are often used to present results of operations (like finding or grepping
files).  Once closed they can be recreated by repeating a command, but it
might be inconvenient (require changing directory, finding the command and
possibly finding position in a menu) and time consuming to re-run the
operation.  To make referring to older menus possible, vifm stores up to 25
last such menus and provides means for recalling them using familiar set of
Vim commands.

As already hinted above, this doesn't apply to every menu because things like
:version or :commands rely solely on internal data and don't
need to be saved.  Only menus that are derived from external sources and
support navigation (like via gf) are remembered.

.B Navigating through history

Re-opening the last viewed menu of relevant type is done by running
:copen command.  Once opened :colder can be used to view older
menus and :cnewer to view newer ones.

Closing a menu after moving through the history remembers the position such
that running :copen again will open the last viewed menu and allow one
to continue exploring history in both directions.

The history always contains menus sorted from oldest to newest.  After opening
more than 25 menus the oldest one is likely to be forgotten.  It's not
guaranteed to happen because after viewing an older menu new entry replaces
all more recent ones.  As an example, assume the history looks like this:

.EX
 1. :find 1
 2. :find 2
 ...
23. :find 23 (current element)
24. :find 24
25. :find 25
.EE

Running `:find 11` results in:

.EX
 1. :find 1
 2. :find 2
 ...
23. :find 23
24. :find 26 (current element)
25. None
.EE

For convenience, :colder and :cnewer can be used any time
you're in a menu, not just after :copen.  :cnewer will work only if
current menu can't be saved and you've moved back in menus history before.
Behaviour of :colder is like this:
 - if current menu can be stashed, behave as :quit, :copen, :colder \
sequence (current menu is stashed the same way as described above)
 - if current menu can't be stashed, behave as :quit, :copen sequence

.B Viewing history

In order to avoid enumerating menus looking for the matching one,
:chistory command can be used to get an overview of saved menus, maybe search
for one and then open it.  The command is also available in menu mode.

.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Custom views
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.B Definition

Normally, file views present a list of files from a single directory, but
sometimes it's useful to populate them with files from unrelated locations.
This is what custom views are mainly for.

.B Presentation

Custom views are still related to the directory they were in before custom
list was loaded.  Path to that directory (original directory) can be seen in
the title of a custom view.

Files in the same directory have to be named differently but custom views are
free from this constraint, hence seeing file names alone might be rather
confusing.  In order to give an idea where files come from paths relative to
the original directory of the view are used, when that's not possible full
paths are shown.

Custom views normally don't contain any inexistent files.

.B Navigation/exiting

Navigation in custom views somewhat differs compared to regular views.

gf - acts similar to gf on symbolic links and navigates to the file at its real
     location.

h - goes to the closest parent node in the tree view or terminates the custom
    view returning to the original directory.

gh - terminates the custom view returning to the original directory.

Going to the parent directory in other ways (whether by opening ".." entry or
executing `:cd ..`) also causes termination and return to the original
location.

All other ways of changing location (e.g., marks, bookmarks, :cd,
:sync) also cause termination of the custom view.

.B History

Custom list exists only while it's visible, once left one can't return to it,
so there is no traces of it in any history.

.B Filters

Only local filter affects contents of the view.  This is intentional.
Presumably, if one loads a particular list, precisely that list should be
displayed (except for inexistent paths, which are ignored).

.B Search

Although directory names are visible in listing, they are not searchable.  Only
file names are taken into account (might be changed in the future, searching
whole lines seems quite reasonable).

.B Sorting

Contrary to search sorting by name works on whole visible part of file path.

.B Highlight

Whole file name is highlighted as one entity, even if there are directory
elements.

.B Updates

Reloads can occur, though they are not automatic due to files being scattered
among different places.  On a reload inexistent files are removed and
meta-data of all other files is updated.

Once custom view forgets about the file, it won't add it back even if it's
created again.  So not seeing file previously affected by an operation which
was later undone is normal.

.B Operations

All operations that add files are forbidden for custom views.  For example,
moving/copying/putting files into a custom view doesn't work, because that's
not a real file system location.

On the other hand, operations that use files of a custom view as a source
(e.g., yanking, copying, moving file from a custom view, deletion) and
operations that modify names are all allowed.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Compare views
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.B Kinds

:compare can produce four different results depending on arguments:
 \- single compare view ("ofone" and either "listall" or "listdups");
 \- single custom view ("ofone" and "listunique");
 \- two compare views ("ofboth" and either "listall" or "listdups");
 \- two custom views ("ofboth" and "listunique").

The first two display files of a single file system tree.  Here duplicates are
files that have at least one copy in the same tree.  The other two kinds of
operation compare two trees, in which duplicates are files that are found in
both trees.

Lists of unique files are presented in custom views because there is no file
grouping to preserve as all file ids are guaranteed to be distinct.  See
"Custom views" section.

.B Creation

Arguments passed to :compare form seven categories each with its own
prefix and is responsible for particular property of the operation.

Which files to compare:
 \- ofboth \- compares files of two panes against each other;
 \- ofone  \- compares files of the same directory.

How files are compared:
 \- byname     \- by their name only;
 \- bysize     \- only by their size;
 \- bycontents \- by data they contain (combination of size and hash of \
small chunk of contents is used as first approximation, so don't worry too \
much about large files; non-regular files like pipes are assumed to be empty).

Which files to display:
 \- listall    \- all files;
 \- listunique \- unique files only;
 \- listdups   \- only duplicated files.

How results are grouped (has no effect if "ofone" specified):
 \- groupids   \- files considered identical are always adjacent in output;
 \- grouppaths \- file system ordering is preferred (this also enables \
displaying identically named files as mismatches).

Which files to omit:
 \- skipempty \- ignore empty files.

Comparison tweaks:
 \- withicase \- ignore case when comparing file names/paths;
 \- withrcase \- respect case when comparing file names/paths.

Which results to show (has no effect for single pane comparison):
 \- showidentical   \- control visibility of identical files;
 \- showdifferent   \- control visibility of changed files;
 \- showuniqueleft  \- control visibility of unique top/left files;
 \- showuniqueright \- control visibility of unique bottom/right files.

Each argument can appear multiple times, the rightmost one of the group
defines the behaviour.  All arguments alter default behaviour instead of
substituting it.

When neither "withicase" nor "withrcase" is specified, case depends on the
running operating system and the file system on which the files are located.

.B Exiting

Comparing two views results in them entering a special state implemented on
top of custom views.  Both views leave this state when either of them stops
being custom.  Custom views terminate on changing to a different location or
as a result of a command like :regular, going into the parent directory
(like with h key or `:cd ..` command) returns to a regular state without
changing the location.  See "Custom views" section for more details.

.B Examples

The defaults correspond to probably the most common use case of comparing
files in two trees with grouping by paths, so the following are equivalent:

.EX
  :compare
  :compare bycontents grouppaths
  :compare bycontents listall ofboth grouppaths
  :compare showidentical showdifferent showuniqueleft showuniqueright
.EE

Another use case is to find duplicates in the current sub-tree:

.EX
  :compare listdups ofone
.EE

The following command lists files that are unique to each pane:

.EX
  :compare listunique
.EE

.B Look

The view can't switch to ls-like view as it's unable to display diff-like
data.

Comparison views have second column displaying id of the file, files with the
same id are considered to be equal.  The view columns configuration is
predefined.

The status bar displays only the initial result of the comparison and can be
out of date.

.B Behaviour

When two views are being compared against one another the following changes to
the regular behaviour apply:
 \- views are scrolled synchronously (as if 'scrollbind' was set);
 \- views' cursors are synchronized;
 \- local filtering is disabled (its results wouldn't be meaningful);
 \- zd excludes groups of adjacent identical files, 1zd gives usual behaviour;
 \- sorting is permanently disabled (ordering is fixed);
 \- removed files hide their counter pairs;
 \- exiting one of the views terminates the other immediately;
 \- renaming files isn't blocked, but isn't taken into account and might \
require regeneration of comparison;
 \- entries which indicate absence of equivalent file have empty names and can \
be matched as such;
 \- when unique files of both views are listed, custom views can be empty, \
 this absence of unique files is stated clearly.

One compare view has similar properties (those that are applicable for single
pane).

Files are gathered in this way:
 \- recursively starting at current location of the view;
 \- dot files are excluded if view hides them at the moment of comparison, file
name filters are obeyed as well so you end up comparing what you see;
 \- directories are not taken into account;
 \- symbolic links to directories are ignored.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Startup
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
On startup vifm determines several variables that are used during execution.
They are determined in the order they appear below.

On *nix systems $HOME is normally present and used as is.
On Windows systems vifm tries to find correct home directory in the following
order:
 \- $HOME variable;
 \- $USERPROFILE variable (on Windows only);
 \- a combination of $HOMEDRIVE and $HOMEPATH variables (on Windows only).

vifm tries to find correct configuration directory by checking the following
places:
 \- $VIFM variable;
 \- parent directory of the executable file (on Windows only);
 \- $HOME/.vifm directory;
 \- $APPDATA/Vifm directory (on Windows only);
 \- $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vifm directory;
 \- $HOME/.config/vifm directory.

vifm tries to find correct configuration file by checking the following places:
 \- $MYVIFMRC variable;
 \- vifmrc in parent directory of the executable file (on Windows only);
 \- $VIFM/vifmrc file.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Configure
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
See "Startup" section above for the explanations on $VIFM and $MYVIFMRC.

The vifmrc file contains commands that will be executed on vifm startup.  There
are two such files: global and local.  Global one is at
{prefix}/etc/vifm/vifmrc, see $MYVIFMRC variable description for the search
algorithm used to find local vifmrc.  Global vifmrc is loaded before the local
one, so that the later one can redefine anything configured globally.

Use vifmrc to set settings, mappings, filetypes etc.  To use multi line commands
precede each next line with a slash (whitespace before slash is ignored, but all
spaces at the end of the lines are saved).  For example:

.EX
  set
      \\smartcase
.EE

equals "setsmartcase".  When

.EX
  set<space here>
      \\ smartcase
.EE

equals "set  smartcase".

The $VIFM/vifminfo file contains generic state of the application.  You can
control what is stored in vifminfo by setting \(aqvifminfo\(aq option.
Vifm always writes this file on exit unless 'vifminfo' option is empty.  Marks,
bookmarks, commands, histories, filetypes, fileviewers and registers in the
file are merged with vifm configuration (which has bigger priority).

Generally, runtime configuration has bigger priority during merging, but there
are some exceptions:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
directory stack stored in the file is not overwritten unless something is
changed in vifm instance that performs merge;
.IP \- 2
each mark or bookmark is marked with a timestamp, so that newer value is not
overwritten by older one, thus no matter from where it comes, the newer one
wins;
.IP \- 2
all histories are marked with timestamps on storing, this means that last
instance to quit puts its elements on top of the list;
.IP \- 2
tabs are merged only if both current instance and stored state contain
exactly one tab of any kind.
.RE

The $VIFM/scripts directory can contain shell scripts.  vifm modifies
its PATH environment variable to let user run those scripts without specifying
full path.  All subdirectories of the $VIFM/scripts will be added to PATH too.
Script in a subdirectory overlaps script with the same name in all its parent
directories.

The $VIFM/colors/ and {prefix}/etc/vifm/colors/ directories contain color
schemes.  Available color schemes are searched in that order, so on name
conflict the one in $VIFM/colors/ wins.

Each color scheme should have ".vifm" extension.  This wasn't the case before
and for this reason the following rules apply during lookup:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
if there is no file with .vifm extension, all regular files are listed;
.IP \- 2
otherwise only files with .vifm extension are listed (with the extension
being truncated).
.RE
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Sessions
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sessions provide a way to have multiple persistent runtime configurations.
Think of them as second-level vifminfo files in addition to the
first-level one used by all sessions.  In other words, they aren't a
replacement for vifminfo file that exists without sessions, but an addition to
it.  One can empty 'vifminfo' option and rely solely on sessions, but in
practice one might want to share some state among instances in different
sessions or have an "out-of-sessions" state for tasks that don't deserve a
session of their own.

This leads to a two-level structure where data in session files has higher
priority than data in vifminfo files (where this makes sense) following the
same rules that merging of vifminfo file obeys.  In addition to that, history
items from session files are never ordered before history items from vifminfo
file.

.B Format

Sessions have the format of vifminfo files, they do not consist of sequence
of command-line commands and are not meant to be sourced via :source
command.

.B Storage and naming

`$VIFM/sessions/` directory serves as a storage for sessions.  Consequently
names should be valid filenames.  The structure of the storage is flat meaning
that there are no subdirectories, that's why names of sessions can't contain
slashes.

.B Usage model

Contrary to Vim, vifm automates basic management of sessions.  You can start,
switch, stop or delete a session using builtin means.

Current session is saved at the same time vifminfo is saved (on normal exits
or explicitly on :write command) and right before switching to another
session.  To avoid saving in those cases use :session command to detach
(without saving) from a session before proceeding.

.SH Automatic FUSE mounts
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
vifm has a builtin support of automated FUSE file system mounts.  It is \
implemented using file associations mechanism.  To enable automated mounts, \
one needs to use a specially formatted program line in filetype or \
filextype commands.  These use special macros, which differ from \
macros in commands unrelated to FUSE.  Currently three formats are supported:

1) FUSE_MOUNT
This format should be used in case when all information needed for mounting \
all files of a particular type is the same.  E.g. mounting of tar files \
don't require any file specific options.

Format line:
  FUSE_MOUNT|mounter %SOURCE_FILE %DESTINATION_DIR [%FOREGROUND]

Example filetype command:

.EX
  :filetype FUSE_MOUNT|fuse\-zip %SOURCE_FILE %DESTINATION_DIR
.EE

2) FUSE_MOUNT2
This format allows one to use specially formatted files to perform mounting \
and is useful for mounting remotes, for example remote file systems over ftp \
or ssh.

Format line:
  FUSE_MOUNT2|mounter %PARAM %DESTINATION_DIR [%FOREGROUND]

Example filetype command:

.EX
  :filetype *.ssh FUSE_MOUNT2|sshfs %PARAM %DESTINATION_DIR
.EE

Example file content:

.EX
  root@127.0.0.1:/
.EE

3) FUSE_MOUNT3

This format is equivalent to FUSE_MOUNT, but omits unmounting.  It \
is useful for cases, when unmounting isn't needed, like when using AVFS.

Example :filetype command:

.EX
  :filetype *.tar,*.tar.bz2,*.tbz2,*.tgz,*.tar.gz,*.tar.xz,*.txz,*.deb
       \\ {Mount with avfs}
       \\ FUSE_MOUNT3|mount-avfs %DESTINATION_DIR %SOURCE_FILE
.EE

Example `mount-avfs` helper script:

.EX
  #!/bin/sh

  dest=$1
  file=$2

  rmdir "$dest"
  ln \-s "$HOME/.avfs$file#/" "$dest"
.EE

All % macros are expanded by vifm at runtime and have the following meaning:
  \- %SOURCE_FILE is replaced by full path to selected file;
  \- %DESTINATION_DIR is replaced by full path to mount directory, which is \
created by vifm basing on the value of 'fusehome' option;
  \- %PARAM value is filled from the first line of file (whole line), though \
in the future it can be changed to whole file content;
  \- %FOREGROUND means that you want to run mount command as a regular \
command (required to be able to provide input for communication with mounter \
in interactive way).

%FOREGROUND is an optional macro.  Other macros are not mandatory, but mount \
commands likely won't work without them.

%CLEAR is obsolete name of %FOREGROUND, which is still supported, but might be \
removed in future.  Its use is discouraged.

Unlike macros elsewhere, these are recognized only if they appear at the end
of a command or are followed by a space.  There is no way to escape % either.
These are historical limitations, which might be addressed in the future.

The mounted FUSE file systems will be automatically unmounted in two cases:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
when vifm quits (with ZZ, :q, etc. or when killed by signal);
.IP \- 2
when you explicitly leave mount point going up to its parent directory (with \
h, Enter on "../" or ":cd ..") and other pane is not in the same directory or \
its child directories.

.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH View look
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
vifm supports displaying of file list view in two different ways:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
in a table mode, when multiple columns can be set using 'viewcolumns' option
(see "Column view" section below for details);
.IP \- 2
in a multicolumn list manner which looks almost like `ls \-x` command output
(see "ls-like view" section below for details).
.RE

The look is local for each view and can be chosen by changing value of the
\(aqlsview\(aq boolean option.

Depending on view look some of keys change their meaning to allow more natural
cursor moving.  This concerns mainly h, j, k, l and other similar navigation
keys.

Also some of options can be ignored if they don't affect view displaying in
selected look.  For example value of 'viewcolumns' when 'lsview' is set.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH ls-like view
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
When this view look is enabled by setting 'lsview' option on, vifm will display
files in multiple columns.  Number of columns depends on the length of the
longest file name present in current directory of the view.  Whole file list is
automatically reflowed on directory change, terminal or view resize.

View looks close to output of `ls \-x` command, so files are listed left to
right in rows.

In this mode file manipulation commands (e.g. d) don't work line-wise like they
do in Vim, since such operations would be uncommon for file manipulation
tasks.  Thus, for example, dd will remove only current file.

By default the view is filled by lines, 'lsoptions' can be used to get filling
by columns.

Note that tree-view and compare view inhibit ls-like view.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Column view
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
View columns are described by a comma-separated list of column descriptions,
each of which has the following format
    [ '\-' | '*' ] [ fw ( [ '.' tw ] | '%' ) ] '{' type | literal '}' '.'{0,3}
.br
where fw stands for full width, tw stands for text width, bar is logical or,
square brackets denote optional parts and curly braces define range of
repetitions for a symbol that precedes them.

So it basically consists of four parts:
 1. Optional alignment specifier
 2. Optional width specifier
 3. Mandatory column name
 4. Optional cropping specifier

.B Alignment specifier

It's an optional minus or asterisk sign as the first symbol of the string.

Specifies type of text alignment within a column.  Three types are supported:
.IP \- 2
left align

.EX
  set viewcolumns=\-{name}
.EE
.IP \- 2
right align (default)

.EX
  set viewcolumns={name}
.EE
.IP \- 2
middle align

It's like left alignment, but when the text is bigger than the column, it
is cut in the middle (so the start and the end of the field are always visible).

.EX
  set viewcolumns=^{name}
.EE
.IP \- 2
dynamic align

It's like left alignment, but when the text is bigger than the column, the
alignment is made at the right (so the part of the field is always visible).

.EX
  set viewcolumns=*{name}
.EE
.LP
.B Width specifier

It's a number followed by a percent sign, two numbers (second one should be
less than or equal to the first one) separated with a dot or a single number.

Specifies column width and its units. There are three size types:
.IP \- 2
absolute size \- column width is specified in characters

.EX
  set viewcolumns=\-100{name},20.15{ext}
.EE

results in two columns with lengths of 100 and 20 and a reserved space of five \
characters on the left of second column.
.IP \- 2
relative (percent) size \- column width is specified in percents of view width

.EX
  set viewcolumns=\-80%{name},15%{ext},5%{mtime}
.EE

results in three columns with lengths of 80/100, 15/100 and 5/100 of view width.
.IP \- 2
auto size (default) \- column width is automatically determined

.EX
  set viewcolumns=\-{name},{ext},{mtime}
.EE

results in three columns with length of one third of view width. There is no \
size adjustment to content, since it will slow down rendering.
.LP
Columns of different sizing types can be freely mixed in one view. Though
sometimes some of columns can be seen partly or be completely invisible if
there is not enough space to display them.
.LP
.B Column contents

This is usually a sorting key surrounded with curly braces, e.g.

.EX
  {name},{ext},{mtime}
.EE

{name} and {iname} types are the same and are both present for consistency
with \(aqsort\(aq option.

The following column types don't have corresponding sorting keys:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
{root}     \- display name without extension (as a complement for {ext})
.IP \- 2
{fileroot} \- display name without extension for anything except for \
directories and symbolic links to directories (as a complement for {fileext})
.RE

Empty curly braces ({}) are replaced with the default secondary column for
primary sort key.  So after the next command view will be displayed almost as
if 'viewcolumns' was empty, but adding ellipsis for long file names:

.EX
  set viewcolumns=\-{name}..,6{}.
.EE

The last kind of column value is a string literal.  The literal is used as a
column value for every row.  The syntax is "{#literal}", examples:

.EX
  " double-character pseudo-padding on both sides
  set viewcolumns='2{#},*{name}..,{},2{#}'
  " pseudo-border between columns
  set viewcolumns='*{name}..,{#|},6{}'
  " pseudo-border with padding between columns
  set viewcolumns='*{name}..,{# | },6{}'
.EE

This can be used to draw column separators.  Mind that for convenience
literals have different defaults: truncation and automatically determined
absolute size, which is what you usually want for them.  Make sure to quote or
escape spaces, vertical bars and other special symbols when using them as part
of literals.
.LP
.B Cropping specifier

It's from one to three dots after closing curly brace in column format.

Specifies type of text truncation if it doesn't fit in the column.  Currently
three types are supported:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
truncation \- text is truncated

.EX
  set viewcolumns=\-{name}.
.EE

results in truncation of names that are too long too fit in the view.
.IP \- 2
adding of ellipsis \- ellipsis on the left or right are added when needed

.EX
  set viewcolumns=\-{name}..
.EE

results in that ellipsis are added at the end of too long file names.
.IP \- 2
none (default) \- text can pass column boundaries

.EX
  set viewcolumns=\-{name}...,{ext}
.EE

results in that long file names can partially be written on the ext column.

.SH Color schemes
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The color schemes in vifm can be applied in two different ways:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
as the primary color scheme;
.IP \- 2
as local to a pane color scheme.
.RE

Both types are set using :colorscheme command, but of different forms:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
:colorscheme color_scheme_name \- for the primary color scheme;
.IP \- 2
:colorscheme color_scheme_name directory \- for local color schemes.
.RE

Look of different parts of the TUI (Text User Interface) is determined in \
this way:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
Border, TabLine, TabLineSel, TopLineSel, TopLine, CmdLine, ErrorMsg, \
StatusLine, JobLine, SuggestBox, WildBox and WildMenu are always determined by \
the primary color scheme;
.IP \- 2
CurrLine, Selected, Directory, Link, BrokenLink, Socket, Device, Executable, \
Fifo, CmpMismatch, CmpUnmatched, CmpBlank, Win, AuxWin and OtherWin are \
determined by primary color scheme and a set of local color schemes, which can \
be empty.
.RE

There might be a set of local color schemes because they are structured
hierarchically according to file system structure. For example, having the
following piece of file system:
.EX

  ~
  `\-\- bin
     |
     `\-\- my

.EE
Two color schemes:
.EX

  # ~/.config/vifm/colors/for_bin.vifm
  highlight Win cterm=none ctermfg=white ctermbg=red
  highlight CurrLine cterm=none ctermfg=red ctermbg=black

  # ~/.config/vifm/colors/for_bin_my.vifm
  highlight CurrLine cterm=none ctermfg=green ctermbg=black

.EE
And these three commands in the vifmrc file:
.EX

  colorscheme Default
  colorscheme for_bin ~/bin
  colorscheme for_bin_my ~/bin/my

.EE
File list will look in the following way for each level:
.IP \- 2
~/ \- Default color scheme
.br
black background
.br
cursor with blue background
.IP \- 2
~/bin/ \- mix of Default and for_bin color schemes

.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Trash directory
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
vifm has support of trash directory, which is used as temporary storage for
deleted files or files that were cut.  Using trash is controlled by the
\(aqtrash\(aq option, and exact path to the trash can be set with 'trashdir'
option.  Trash directory in vifm differs from the system-wide one by default,
because of possible incompatibilities of storing deleted files among different
file managers.  But one can set 'trashdir' to "~/.local/share/Trash" to use a
"standard" trash directory.

There are two scenarios of using trash in vifm:
.RS 2
.IP 1. 3
As a place for storing files that were cut by "d" and may be inserted to some
other place in file system.
.IP 2. 3
As a storage of files, that are deleted but not purged yet.
.RE

The first scenario uses deletion ("d") operations to put files to trash and
put ("p") operations to restore files from trash directory.  Note that such
operations move files to and from trash directory, which can be long term
operations in case of different partitions or remote drives mounted locally.

The second scenario uses deletion ("d") operations for moving files to trash
directory and :empty command-line command to purge all previously deleted files.

Deletion and put operations depend on registers, which can point to files in
trash directory.  Normally, there are no nonexistent files in registers, but
vifm doesn't keep track of modifications under trash directory, so one
shouldn't expect value of registers to be absolutely correct if trash
directory was modified not by operation that are meant for it.  But this
won't lead to any issues with operations, since they ignore nonexistent
files.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH File copying
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
For enabling copy-on-write of BTRFS on Linux, set "fastfilecloning" flag of
\(aqiooptions\(aq option.

File copying within an XFS file system uses reflinks by default.  Any file
copied from another file system will be copied without reflinks even if it has
a matching list of XFS extents.  Reflinks are not guaranteed when using
external programs.  This behaviour was observed on Linux and doesn't
necessarily hold for other environments.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH Client\-Server
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
vifm supports remote execution of command-line mode commands, remote changing of
directories and expression evaluation.  This is possible using \-\-remote
and \-\-remote\-expr command-line arguments.

To execute a command remotely combine \-\-remote argument with \-c <command> or
+<command>.  For example:

.EX
  vifm \-\-remote \-c 'cd /'
  vifm \-\-remote '+cd /'
.EE

To change directory not using command-line mode commands one can specify paths
right after \-\-remote argument, like this:

.EX
  vifm \-\-remote /
  vifm \-\-remote ~
  vifm \-\-remote /usr/bin /tmp
.EE

Evaluating expression remotely might be useful to query information about an
instance, for example its location:

.EX
  vifm \-\-remote\-expr 'expand("%d")'
.EE

If there are several running instances, the target can be specified with
\-\-server\-name option (otherwise, the first one lexicographically is used):

.EX
  vifm \-\-server-name work \-\-remote ~/work/project
.EE

List of names of running instances can be obtained via \-\-server\-list option.
Name of the current one is available via v:servername.

.TP
.BI "v:servername"
server name of the running vifm instance.  Empty if client-server feature is
disabled.

Order of lines correspond to the order of files in a view.
.IP 2. 3
Lines that start with a "#" are comments and are ignored.
.IP 3. 3
Single backslash at the beginning of a line is ignored, so that a file
starting with a backslash will appear like "\\#name".

If an operation was rejected due to issues with file names, next time you'll see
the following in this order:
.RS 2
.IP 1. 3
Last error (in comments).

Mind that Vim plugin will extract list of original names and show them in a

.SH Plugin
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plugin for using vifm in vim as a file selector.

Commands:

  :EditVifm   select a file or files to open in the current buffer.
  :Vifm       alias for :EditVifm.
  :SplitVifm  split buffer and select a file or files to open.
  :VsplitVifm vertically split buffer and select a file or files to open.
  :DiffVifm   select a file or files to compare to the current file with
              :vert diffsplit.
  :TabVifm    select a file or files to open in tabs.

Each command accepts up to two arguments: left pane directory and right pane
directory.  After arguments are checked, vifm process is spawned in a special
"file-picker" mode.  To pick files just open them either by pressing l, i or
Enter keys, or by running :edit command.  If no files are selected, file
under the cursor is opened, otherwise whole selection is passed to the plugin
and opened in vim.

The plugin have only two settings.  It's a string variable named g:vifm_term to
let user specify command to run GUI terminal.  By default it's equal to
\(aqxterm \-e\(aq.  And another string variable named g:vifm_exec, which equals
"vifm" by default and specifies path to vifm's executable.  To pass arguments to
vifm use g:vifm_exec_args, which is empty by default.

To use the plugin copy the vifm.vim file to either the system wide vim/plugin
directory or into ~/.vim/plugin.

If you would prefer not to use the plugin and it is in the system wide plugin
directory add

let loaded_vifm=1

to your ~/.vimrc file.
