Basic things that need to be done.
    Termcap or terminfo support for keybindings (do we need this? curses does).
    Backgrounding of commands with job control (pause/resume/kill).
    Show background commands presence in the TUI.
    Fix window resizing (I think it's almost done).
    Handle commands that are too long to be passed directly to the shell.
    Perform operations using system calls, not programs.  This is much faster.
    Show operation progress.
    Maybe remove 'trash' option, since we have two commands for deletion.
    Templates for :touch.
    Mouse support.
    Ctrl-R combinations in the command-line mode.
    Wrapping of lines in the menus.
    IPC among all running vifm instances (share settings among instances).
    Make status bar able to display error and info messages at the same time.
    Command to create multiple copies of selected one with ability to rename
        it (e.g. a -> :hub b c -> a b c, a -> :hub! b c -> b c).
    Make :filetype, :filextype and :fileviewer show menus with 0 or 1 args.
    Add :increment and :decrement commands, which should work in two modes
        in the same way as Ctrl-X/Ctrl-A and like their combination with :clone.
    Improve ga and gA commands to recalculate sizes of modified directories
        only, and maybe update size of all parent cached directories. And maybe
        show somehow in the TUI calculation process.
    Make ga and gA work in visual mode.
    Better remove confirmation messages (should contain list of files).
    Better failed operation messages (list of errors, not just one first error).
    Fix gU, gu and ignore case name sort on filenames with non-latin characters.
    Cancel calls of external applications on Ctrl-C, e.g. after `:grep`.
    Process shell pause request for running in %s.

Documentation.
    Better documentation.
    Maybe divide vifm.txt in several files (if it becomes too big).
    Document single and double quotes treating in the command-line mode.
    Document name conflict resolution options.

Windows.
    Make :chmod accept arguments.
    Make properties dialog change file attributes recursively.
    Add a command to create .lnk files.
    Follow targets of .lnk files.
    Fix freezing (maybe already fixed).
    Use UTF8 internally.
    Make 'fastrun' understand file extensions on Windows (to ignore them).
    Maybe read first bytes of files and threat files as executable if first
        two bytes equal to '$!'.
    Make 'slowfs' option available on Windows and provide a support for builtin
        file system time 'winnetwork', which will mean network resources.
    Maybe sort completion items ignoring their case on Windows.
    Handle numpad keys better, just like corresponding non-numpad keys.

Vi(m) specific features that need to be added.
    Fix '' to go back to all jumps G gg links (in one directory?).
    Change file list filters to use fold levels instead of just
        the dot filter and regular expression filter (what does this mean?).
    Some kind of selection mode (multiple blocks, mixing).
    Better registers support.
    /, ?, n, N as selectors.
    Make n, N, / and ? with count behave like Vim on nowrapscan and match fail
        (this means "don't move cursor on search failure").
    :map without arguments
    Better ranges (add support for search patterns).
    Ctrl-W F key.
    'wildignore' ('wig') option (also think about it in context of file
        filtering).
    Kinda macros like in Vim (qa ... q).
    Something like <silent> in Vim (no command blinking in the command-line)
    :let mapleader and <leader> support.
    'cdpath' ('cd') option.
    Completion of first argument for :map commands.
    Support hex and octal numbers in :set
    Add support for ^= in :set command.
    Add support for directory completion for some of :set options.
    Add support of 'n' flag for :substitute command.
    Expand environment variables for :edit command.
    Think about dot normal mode command.
    Add support of [count] for Ctrl-E/Ctrl-Y/H/M/L.
    Completion based on global (when one enters pattern<tab>, e.g. *.c<tab>).
    Quickfix list support (to navigate through file list produced by :find or
        :locate with :cn, :cp and alike).
    Maybe add 'titleold' option.
    Maybe add "%p" and "%P" macros to 'rulerformat' option.
    Support :set foo+=bar for strings (should append value).
    Make gU2U and similar commands work as in Vim.
    Lazy redraw support (useful for mappings and udf).
    'nrformats' option as in Vim.

Possible things to add.
    Use system wide mimetypes file. /etc/mailcap?
    Virtual File System - currently vifm can use fuse to mount most
        file systems.
    Invert selection? (what :command or key?)
    Make :undolist more interactive.
    Maybe something like :g/.../com and :v/.../com in Vim.
    Add g/ and g? commands (search, but don't select files).
    Reverse searching (/ for search, g/ for selecting, g!/ for selecting
        reverse)
    Improve sorting (maybe iext; maybe ignore dirs).
    Add :mksession command and 'sessionoptions' option.
    Position macros for user defined commands (%1, %2, ..., %9). Something
        like %!1 could be used for mandatory parameters.
    Some key to (un)select all files with extension of current file.
    Maybe we should not reread configuration files on :restart when
        --no-configs was passed on startup.
    'wildmode' option.
    A macro to redirect command output into view pane.
    $_ env var and Alt-T combination as in bash shell.
    Rename existing file option on name conflicts.
    Support of command line arguments like ~/some.ssh/server/path (for FUSE).
    Think about running vim on :help command in kind of sandbox, so the only
        help files available were those provided by vifm.
    Maybe provide a way to skip non-existent directory errors on <c-o>/<c-i>.
    Something to control the frequency of directory change changes.
    Invalidate calculated directory size if it's modification time changed.
    Merge directory stacks in vifminfo file. Need to come up with a good
        policy about this.
    Add search history for less-like mode.
    Update visible symbolic links in the other pane on updating current pane
        (to show broken links to the user).
    Print an error message when navigation to a menu item failed.
    Highlight first line of command-editing buffer of vifm in different
        color, like gitcommit syntax file does.

Other (questionable) things.
    Use mimetypes in FILETYPE.
    %i macro to prompt user for input.
    Maybe inotify support on Linux.
    Command like ' but that executes bookmark ?
    Maybe we should add a command to view screen ?
    Add support for comments at the end of line ? Just for fun?
    Make directory stack menu interactive ?
    Maybe add + and - commands to undo by commands, not command groups.
    :setlocal command.
    Remove items from :history command menu?
    :edit, etc. in the menus.
    :alias
    Like gv but to select just pasted files (gp?).
    Modify marks on rename operations.
    :toupper and :tolower
    Maybe accept regular expressions as second argument of :colo command.
    Make :alink, :copy, ... accept globs (e.g. :co *.c).
    Option to trigger completion on slash in command-line.
    Maybe expand macros for :touch amd :mkdir commands (for :touch %"d)
    Live preview of color schemes.
    "Blow directory" command to replace directory with its content.
    Add file selector based on file extensions.
    Add zr normal key to remove local file name filter.
    Add a key to menu mode to repeat command and update menu.
    :edit - select the file after exiting editor?
    Add a builtin function (or variable?) to get number of selected files
        in a view (at least in current).  To be used in udf commands to
        make a choice between using %b and %f.  Or maybe adding a macro
        for this is a better way to go?
    Add a builtin function to check whether some external application is
        available?
    Use custom title for fuse mounts, e.g.:
        - fuse://...
        - /../fuse_file/...

Code improvements.
    Write more tests.
    Improve logging (print back trace in some cases, increase verbosity).
    Add logging levels.
    Stay at the same file in some cases.
    Store directories names without slash symbol.
    Replace a lot of fields in cmd_add_t struct with a set of bit flags.
    Change type of pause argument of shellout() function to an enum.
    Maybe move startup and initialization code out of config.c and vifm.c
        to a separate file.
    Get rid of repeatable `menu->win_rows - 3` in menu.c.
    Get rid of repeatable `(menu->win_rows - 3 + 1)/2 - 1` in menu.c.
    Think about window_rows and window_width members of FileView: why
        do they contain (rows - 1) and (width - 1) ?
    Get file size on Windows using GetFileAttributesEx().
    Reduce number of magic numbers.
    List of errors, which are accumulated and shown at appropriate time (try
        sourcing colorscheme with scripting errors to understand the issue).
    Fix code duplication related to composing of undo messages.
    On Windows check for cmd shell when it's set instead of checking it every
        time it is used.
    Maybe show "An error occurred" message on fail to build menus like
        apropos or locate instead of "No files found" (check that list is
        empty AND an error occurred).
    Replace calls like `snprintf(foo, sizeof(foo), "%s", line)` with copy_str().
    Rename escape_filename() to shell_escape() or similar, but quite generic.
    Maybe allow specifying limit of input characters for command-line prompt
        submode. Would it make conflict resolution prompt easier to use?
    Maybe pass var by pointer to var_free and cleanup the structure.
    Write more tests for get_lines functions in string_array.c
