### **vifm** - vi[m] like file manager, _v0.10_, _2001 – 2019_

_This file last updated on 11 November, 2018_

## Brief Description ##

Vifm is a curses based vi[m] like file manager extended with some useful
ideas from mutt.  If you use vi[m], vifm gives you complete keyboard control
over your files without having to learn a new set of commands.  It goes not
just about vi[m] like keybindings, but also about modes, options, registers,
commands and other things you might already like in vi[m].

Just like vi[m], vifm tries to adhere to the Unix philosophy.  So instead of
working solutions which are set in stone user is provided with a set of
means for customization of vifm to one's likings.  Though builtin
functionality should be enough for most of use cases.
