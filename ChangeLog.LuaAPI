The API is experimental and having a change log is useful to have for
adjusting plugins as the implementation changes.  During development of the
API things should stay fairly stable to not cause breakage too often, but
while stabilizing for v1.0 a bunch of breaking changes can happen at once.
After that all changes will be documented in the regular ChangeLog.

	Additions to enabled standard libraries:

	 * write a 'tabline' generator
	 * running code before exit and when a file operation is done
	 * starting background jobs to do something when they're over

	 * fully integrate an arbitrary editor by using a handler in 'vicmd' or
	   'vixcmd'
	 * defining custom keys and selectors

	Added vifm.escape() that escapes input to make it suitable for use in an
	external command for current value of the 'shell' option.

	Completors of a Lua-defined :command can now provide descriptions of
	completion items.

0.11 to 0.12 (2021-09-29)

	The following standard libraries are enabled:
	 * basic (core global functions)

	 * mathematical functions (`math` table)
	 * time subset of OS facilities (`clock`, `date`, `difftime` and `time`
	   elements of `os` table)

	 This is what one can do by using Lua at the moment:
	  * commands with completion
	  * save and reset options (e.g., some kind of presets)
	  * custom columns
	  * filetype/filextype/fileviewer/%q handlers
	  * 'statusline' generator
