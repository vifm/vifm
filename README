Brief Description

    Vifm is a Vim-like file manager with curses interface extended with some
    useful ideas from mutt.  If you use Vim, Vifm gives you complete keyboard
    control over your files without having to learn a new set of commands.  It
    goes not just about Vim-like keybindings, but also about modes, options,
    registers, commands and other things you might already like in Vim.

    Just like Vim, Vifm tries to adhere to the Unix philosophy.  So instead of
    working solutions which are set in stone user is provided with a set of
    means for customization of Vifm to one's likings.  Though builtin
    functionality should be enough for most of use cases.
