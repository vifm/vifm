Vifm - vi[m] like file manager
2001 - 2014

Updated: 06 December, 2014
Version: 0.7.8

Brief Description

    Vifm is a two panel ncurses based vi[m] like file manager. If you use vi,
    vifm gives you complete keyboard control over your files without having
    to learn a new set of commands. It goes not just about vi[m] like
    keybindings, but also about modes, options, registers, commands and other
    things you might already like in vi[m].

    Just like vi vifm tries to adhere to the Unix philosophy. So instead of
    working solutions user is provided with a set of means for customization
    of vifm. Though builtin functionality should be enough for most of use
    cases.
