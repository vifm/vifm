The basic vi key bindings are used to move through the files and popup 
	windows.

			k is up
			j is down

	h is updir	
	l is handle file and is the same as Return.

	Ctrl-c or the Escape key will cancel most operations.
	Ctrl-l will clear and redraw the screen.
	
	gg top of list
	G bottom of list
	cw change word is used to rename a file.
	m [a-z][A-Z][0-9] to set bookmark
	' letter to goto bookmark
	v start or stop visualy selecting files.  This works with the j and k keys
		for movement.  This is different then in vi in that v in visual mode will
		leave the selected files highlighted.  If you want to clear the selected 
		files Ctrl-c or Esc will unselect the files.
	dd - the default setting is to move the selected files to the trash
		directory.  
	yy - will yank the selected files.
	p - will copy the yanked files to the current directory or move the files 
		to the current directory if they were deleted with dd or :d or if the
		files were yanked 'yy' from the Trash directory.

	Space or Tab to switch lists.

	Most movement commands also accept a count  12j would move down 12 lines.
	[count] % percent of file list
	[count] j or k
	[count] G or gg
	[count] dd or yy the count is from the current file downward.
	:[count] user command is not yet implemented.
	:[count] command
		 The only builtin :[count] command is :[count]d[elete].  :3d would delete 
		 three files starting at the current file position moving down.

  :number - move to the line number :12  would move to the 12th line.
		:0 move to the top of the list.
		:$ move to the bottom of the list.

	Return  or l -  handle file
		Default file type program or if on a directory enter the directory

	Ctrl-g toggles full file information window.
	Ctrl-b - jump back one page.
	Ctrl-f - jump forward one page.

	/regular expression pattern - will highlight all files matching the pattern 
	in the current file list. /\.c$ would highlight all the .c files.
		N find previous match.
		n find next match.

	Files can also be tagged or selected with 't'.  Pressing 't' on a selected 
	file will unselect it.  This can be used by itself to select files or with a 
	/search pattern  or with visually selected files.

	:commands
	:com is a menu of user commands
	:com name action - will set a new user command 
		Unlike vim user commands do not have to start with a capital letter.
		User commands are run in a shell by default.  To run a command in 
		the background you must set it as a background command with & at the end 
		of the commands action.
		:com rm rm %f &

	:apropos manpage - will create a menu with the results from the 
		apropos command.
	:com! name action - will overwrite a preciously set command.
	:delc command_name will remove the command_name user command
	:fil regular_expression pattern will filter the files out of the directory 
		listing that match the regular expression.
		:fil \.o$ - would filter all files ending in .o from the filelist.
	:empty will permanently remove 'rm -fr' files from the Trash directory.
	:locate filename - will create a menu with the results from the locate
		command.
	:sh will start a shell
	:q or :x will exit vifm
	:! program will execute the program in a shell
		:!command &   will run the process in the background.
			programs that write to stdout like ls will create an error message
			showing partial output of the command.
	:!!  same as :! but will pause the screen before returning to vifm.
		:!!ls -l
	:e load file into vi
	:only - switch to a one window view.
	:pwd - show the present working directory 
	:ch[ange] - create a menu window to alter a files properties.
	:cd - change directory
		:cd ~/bin
	:s[ort] - popup menu of different sorting methods
	:sp[lit] - switch to a two window view.
	:his[tory] - popup menu of directories visited
	:jobs - shows menu of current backgrounded processes.
	:view - toggle on and off the quick file view.
	:h[elp] - this crude help file
	:marks - popup menu of bookmarks
	:screen toggles whether to use the screen program or not.
	:sync - change the other panel to the current panel directory.


command macros
	%a user arguments
	%f all of the selected files
	%F all of the selected files in the other directory list.
	%d current directory name
	%D other file list directory name
	:com mv mv %f %D
		would set the mv command to mv all of the selected files to the other
		directory.

		If you want a command to accept arguments you must use %a.
		:com mkdir mkdir %a &
		:com mygrep vim "+grep %a"
		%a is simply replaced with the user arguments and the arguments are 
		considered to be optional.   
		:com lsl ls -l %a | less  - would run ls -l | less with or without 
		an argument being given.  

search patterns can be set with :com name /pattern
	:com backup /~$
	
	
	file filters
	The basic vim folding key bindings are used for filtering files.
	zO show the filtered files
	zM Filter the files matching the filename filter.
	zo show all the dot files
	zm filter all the .dot files
	zf filter all the selected files
		This will work with all selecting methods.  Visually selecting files,
		using a / search pattern or in combination with 't'.
	:fil[ter] regular expression
	:in[vert] invert the filter
	All directorys will show the ../ file no matter what the filter setting is
	with the exception of the / directory.
	Each file list has its own filter.
	filtered files are not checked in / search or :commands

	file name filters can be set with :com name fil pattern
																	:com ofiles fil \.o$

Configuration.

	The default configuration file is ~/.vifm/vifmrc.
	If you want to change any settings vifm must not be running when you edit 
	the file as it will overwrite any changes you make when it exits.

	Screen configuration.  If you use the screen program, vifm can be configured
	to use a new screen window for opening files or running :!programs.

Misc.
	Ctrl-c or Escape to clear all selected files

	vifm.vim is a vim plugin that allows the use of vifm from vim.  It is
	included in the source tarball but it is not installed by default and must 
	be manually placed in either the default vim/plugin directory or in 
	~/.vim/plugin/ 
	To use vifm to load a file into a running vim use the following commands:
		:Edit - open a file in the current buffer.
		:Split - split the buffer and open a file.
		:Vsplit - vertically split a buffer and open a file.
		:Diff - open a file to compare to the current file using the vim :diff
			command.
	You can edit the vifm.vim script to change the command name used if they 
	conflict with other user commands.

	Starting options:
		/full/path/to/directoryone - using vifm /usr/local will start vifm 
			with the /usr/local directory.  The default is to start vifm in 
			the current directory.
		/full/path/to/directorytwo - using two full paths will start vifm with
			the first path in the left file list and the second path in the right
			file list.
		--version - will print the version number and exit.
		--help - will show help file.
		-f - will run vifm but selecting a file will write the file name to 
			~/.vifm/vimfiles instead of opening the file.  This is used for the 
			vifm.vim script to load files from vifm into a running vim.

Menus
	bookmarks escape or Ctrl-c to abort j and k to move through 
		dd on a bookmark to remove. 

	sort menu j and k to move - Escape or Ctrl-c to clear - return or l to
	select and exit the menu.
