vifm v0.7.6 release
-------------------

New minor version brings better integration with environment and external tools
as well as enhances file filtering capabilities in several ways.  Apart from
that, old features were tweaked and some build issues and bugs were resolved.
New Win32 and Win64 single-executable (no DLLs) packages appear first time with
this release.

This time beta stage was quite fruitful.  Thanks to all who installed and tried
beta versions, and special thanks to filterfalse.

Main changes:
 - added interactive local filter;
 - added external editing of command-line content with 'vicmd';
 - added integration with tmux;
 - added options to configure external commands for :apropos, :find, :grep
   and :locate commands;
 - added desktop entry file (\*nix only) and updated application icon;
 - fixed build for some combinations of OS/environments (OS X, 32/64-bit
   cygwin, Windows).

Notice: if you mapped q key to something, new q:, q/, q? and q= keys won't be
available; suggested solution is to change the mapping to qq.

More detailed list of changes.

Performance:
 - increased performance of (re)loading content for view mode (thanks to Robert
   Sarkozi).

Key bindings:
 - process [count] passed to gUU, gU<selector>, gUgU, gu<selector>, guu and gugu
   commands;
 - made all Ctrl-W x keys available in view mode (thanks to filterfalse);
 - changed meaning of the R key in view mode from redrawing view to reloading it
   preserving scroll position (thanks to Robert Sarkozi).

Normal and visual modes related changes:
 - added q:, q/, q? and q= keys (q= is defined for normal mode only) to prompt
   for command-line in external editor;
 - added "=" normal mode key, which activates file name filtering.

Command-line mode related changes:
 - added "=" and "filter" values for :history command, to show history of local
   filter;
 - added Ctrl-G key to start editing in external editor (for editing command,
   search pattern and file renames);
 - added optional argument for :invert command to control more kinds of
   inversion (thanks to filterfalse);
 - better order of command validity checks;
 - show better error message on unmatched quotes in command arguments;
 - store cancelled prompt input in prompt history;
 - check destination path existence before changing directory to it on :sync
   command;
 - use last search pattern as filename filter when :filter command gets an empty
   argument (:filter//, :filter"", :filter'') (thanks to filterfalse);
 - match only filename against pattern in :fileviewer instead of full path.

:set command and options:
 - added 'aproposprg', 'findprg', 'grepprg' and 'locateprg' options to specify
   external commands format;
 - added "fhistory" to 'vifminfo', which controls storing of local filter
   history;
 - added "f" flag to 'cpoptions' option.  It controls initial state of filename
   filter inversion for :filter[!] {regex} command (thanks to filterfalse);
 - from now on not absolute paths for the 'fusehome' options are rejected;
 - expand environment variables in values of the 'fusehome' and 'trashdir'
   options (thanks to filterfalse);
 - more adequate reaction on setting 'trashdir' option to wrong value;
 - do not reset selection on search when 'hlsearch' is reset (thanks to
   filterfalse).

File filtering:
 - distinguish files and directories in filename filter by appending a slash to
   names of directories;
 - separated file name filter into manual and automatic, mainly for convenience.

TUI (Text User Interface):
 - preserve current cursor position on view resorting;
 - force split-view when two paths are specified on command-line (thanks to
   filterfalse);
 - consider 'classify' option on displaying file name in the statusbar (thanks
   to Thomas Nemeth).

   Sarkozi).

Other changes:
 - added integration with tmux (thanks to Seth VanHeulen, a.k.a. svanheulen);
 - added desktop entry file (thanks to Richard Benson);
 - added merge option for name conflict resolution, which allows for merging two
   directories overwriting files with matching names;
 - updated application icon (thanks to Richard Benson for making it);
 - don't overwrite directory stack stored in vifminfo on exit unless it was
   changed in current session;
 - improved documentation on several subjects;
 - display error after sourcing file with unmatched :if/:endif
   statements (thanks to filterfalse).

Major fixes:
 - fixed configuration when wcscasecmp(), wcsncasecmp() or set\_escdelay()
   functions is not available (thanks to Russell Urquhart);
 - fixed reserving of about 1 GiB piece of memory on 256-color terminals (sorry
   about that);
 - fixed running of executable with symbols that require escaping in their
   name (\*nix only).  Strangely enough, it wasn't noticed before;
 - fixed terminal hang after executing several external commands in a
   row (thanks to filterfalse);
 - fixed search of the first element in file list when displaying of parent
   directory is disabled;
 - fixed fails on running executables when 'fastrun' option is on (thanks to
   MadMaverick9).

features.  The release fixes more than 17 bugs found since version
0.7.4a.

Two weeks since beta version was published have passed.  Since no bugs
were reported, the beta version is now released as 0.7.4b without
any changes except version number.

Fixes in this version are related to the following subjects:
 - interaction with the screen tool (thanks to Jing Liu);
 - working with registers (old, but unreported bugs);
 - rights elevation and dot directories on Windows;
 - processing of vifminfo file (thanks to Christoph, a.k.a informationen);
 - handling of colorscheme files (thanks to Charles Kauffman);
 - displaying of CJK characters (thanks to lcj);
 - 'classify' option (thanks to Thomas Nemeth).

-------------------------------------

This version is a minor bugfix release.  It doesn't contain any new

Because of promise not to release anything without beta-testing,
even this bugfix release has a beta stage, which should last about
two weeks. In case some bugs will be found, a second beta will be
released in a week.

Fixes are related to the following subjects:

vifm v0.7.4a
------------

0.7.4 package contains configuration files of autotools of different
versions.  As a result it's not always possible to build vifm 0.7.4 by
running `./configure && make`.  The author is sorry about wasted time
of users spent on building vifm with partially broken build system.

Anyway this mistake has also a good point.  0.7.4a fixes several bugs,
some of which are related to new features.

See change log for full list of fixes.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

October 18, 2012
================

vifm v0.7.4
-----------

0.7.4 is a minor release, which improves existing features as well as adds
some new ones.

There are two main directions in which improvements were made.  One of them
is TUI, which now has support of multiple columns and ls-like view as well as
customizable file name decoration (prefix and suffix).  The second one is
connected with command interpreter, which now supports builtin functions,
conditional operators and conditional execution of commands
(using if-else-endif statements).  Additionally, vifm's memory footprint was
made smaller and running of programs associated with files made smarter
(won't stop until existing program is found).

Main changes:
 - new multicolumn view;
 - new ls-like view (see 'lsview' option) and related keys for it;
 - prefixes and suffixes of files of different types are configurable now;
 - smarter handling of file associations (now vifm will try to find existing
   program);
 - some basic means to do scripting (if-else-endif statements, builtin
   functions, comparison operators);
 - reduced history memory consumption;
 - better configure script, which now checks more stuff (and does it in a
   more accurate way) needed to build vifm.

More detailed list of changes.

Configuration:
 - removed compile-time compatibility mode (the compatibility-mode switch),
   now "f" flag in 'cpoptions' does the same;
 - added --without/[with]-X11 configure script option;
 - configure script now checks much more then before;
 - better make files (thanks to Hendrik Jaeger).

Only on Windows:
 - replaced gl normal mode mapping for Windows with gr because of conflict
   (with 'lsview');
 - allow paths in :file[x]type command that contain spaces to be doublequoted
   on Windows.

Normal and visual modes related changes:
 - added Ctrl-W H/J/K/L normal mode keys;
 - added gh, gj, gk and gl keys for normal and visual modes;
 - added 0, ^ and $ keys for normal and visual modes, which also work as
   selectors in normal mode.

Command-line mode related changes:
 - added Ctrl-T handling in command line to swap characters;
 - added Meta-. handling in command line to paste last parts of previous
   commands;
 - added :echo command;
 - added :if, :else and :endif commands;
 - added support for `==` and `!=` operators;
 - added :normal command;
 - added mapping commands for view and menu modes;
 - changed relative path base for :split and :vsplit commands;
 - expand macros for user defined commands.

:set command and options:
 - added 'viewcolumns' local option to control view columns;
 - added 'lsview' option to control ls-like view look;
 - added 'dotdirs' option to control visibility of "../" directory;
 - added 'classify' option to set prefixes and suffixes for different file
   types;
 - added %E 'statusline' option macro, which means size of all selected files
   or current file, if no files are selected;
 - added "t" flag to 'cpoptions' option (replaces compile-time compatibility
   mode).

Completion:
 - added completion for :set option= even for options without variants;
 - complete only directory names for :split and :vsplit commands;
 - escape pipe character during :file completion;
 - complete :set for short and full option names like Vim does (e.g. 'so'
   should be expanded to 'sort', not only 'scrolloff').

TUI (Terminal User Interface):
 - added status bar messages for :apropos, :find and :locate commands;
 - flicker less on :restart command;
 - don't show Ctrl-C part in information message boxes where it doesn't make
   sense;
 - reduce delay between terminal resize and TUI redrawing;
 - fixed background bold (light) colors in linux native console.

Color scheme related changes:
 - added light versions of color names.

Key bindings:
 - don't pause on '0' after Ctrl-W (count cannot start with zero);
 - multiply counts in front and in the middle of commands with Ctrl-W (as Vim
   does);
 - multiply counts in front of command and its selector (as Vim does).

Other changes:
 - added support for builtin functions and filetype() as the first one;
 - check current view of other pane on leaving FUSE mount directory an don't
   unmount if that file system is still in use;
 - try the rest of the programs for an association when the default one isn't
   found;
 - reduced memory consumption of view histories.

And fixes of bugs and memory leaks.

vifm v0.7.3a
------------

It happens some bugs are discovered just after making a new release.  And it
happened with vifm 0.7.3, which was tested, but apparently not enough.  So
0.7.3a is a bugfix release, which contains fixes for one serious bug and
several small ones as well as adds some more information to the documentation
and very small enhancements.

If you would like to be notified about future releases of vifm or some
important news related to vifm by email, consider subscribing to recently
created vifm-announce@lists.sourceforge.net read-only mailing list.  You can
do this by following this link.

Though this is a bugfix release it has some changes since v0.7.3 that should
be mentioned:

Completion:
 - better completion for :colorscheme command.

Documentation:
 - added a section about color schemes to the documentation;
 - documented that %m, %M, %s, %S and %i have bigger priority than &;
 - documented that %m, %M, %s, %S and %i are mutually exclusive;
 - documented treating of whitespace around option names in :set command.

:set command and options:
 - allowed whitespace after option name in :set command;
 - added checks for correct value of 'tabstop' and 'timeoutlen' options;
 - reset 'columns' and 'lines' options to real number of columns;
 - reset value of 'scrolloff' option to zero on attempt to assign a negative
   value to it;
 - faster execution of `:set sort=foo sortorder sortnumbers` in vifmrc.

TUI (Terminal User Interface):
 - faster redrawing of statusbar with "-- VISUAL --" message after "Press
   Enter" message.

Command-line mode related changes:
 - expand tilde in the second argument of :colorscheme command;
 - forbid relative paths in :colorscheme command until vifm is completely
   loaded;
 - pass range given to alias to an aliased command.

Performance:
 - faster Ctrl-W x, Ctrl-W o, Ctrl-W s, Ctrl-W v, Ctrl-W =, Ctrl-W <,
   Ctrl-W >, Ctrl-W -, Ctrl-W +, Ctrl-W |, Ctrl-W _;
 - faster redraw on terminal resizing;
 - made file filtering using regular expressions work faster (matters when
   directory contains several thousands files);
 - draw quickview on startup only once.

Normal and visual modes related changes:
 - show correct number of selected files in visual mode after n and N keys.

And bug fixes.

vifm v0.7.0 is out!
-------------------

And as it was promised vifm is back on Windows!

This release breaks compatibility a little, which was done intensionally to
make vifm more vi-like.  I hope that wont make too much discomfort for users,
at least I tried to reduce discomfort as much as I can.  In particular, an
utility program named vifmrc-converter is shipped with vifm now.  It's main
purpose is to automatically convert configuration files (vifmrc, vifminfo,
startup and colorschemes files) to new format.  You don't have to run it by
yourself, vifm will do this for you after asking some questions at first
startup.

Here are the main changes by categories.

Configuration:
 - changed format of ~/.vifm/vifmrc and ~/.vifm/vifminfo files;
 - removed support of startup file, all commands will be automatically moved
   to the vifmrc file;
 - added support for multi line commands in the vifmrc (ex-startup) file;
 - now users can place scripts for vifm to ~/.vifm/scripts, vifm modifies its
   PATH environment variable to let user run scripts without specifying full
   path;
 - now vifm also accepts paths to files as the startup arguments and
   --no-configs option.

Normal and visual modes related changes:
 - added gf, al, rl and cl commands for dealing with symbolic links;
 - added gu and gU commands (and their variations);
 - added gs command to work with t selection like gv with visual mode
   selection;
 - made C handle selection, check read permission and work in visual mode;
 - changed the way l key handles selection and made it work in visual mode.

Command-line mode related changes:
 - removed :cmdhistory command, use :history cmd or ":history :" instead;
 - added :noremap, :cnoremap, :nnoremap, :vnoremap, :unmap, :cunmap, :nunmap
   and :vunmap commands;
 - added :filetype, :filextype and :fileviewer commands;
 - added :find and :grep commands;
 - added :substitute and :tr commands;
 - added :clone, :copy, :move, :alink and :rlink commands;
 - added :chmod, :chown, :mkdir and :touch commands;
 - added :mark, :delmarks, :comclear, :highlight, :restart and :messages
   command;
 - documented command line keys and marked which :commands accept ranges;
 - now vifm understands user name after tilde in paths;
 - let user use short forms of user-defined commands with "!".

Completion:
 - added completion for co, cg, cw and cW commands;
 - sort completion items;
 - shift-Tab command line key to perform completion in reversed order;
 - added Ctrl-_ command-line key to reject completion.

Macros:
 - added filename modifiers (:p, :~, :., :h, :t, :r, :e, :s and :gs);
 - added %S and %M macros;
 - added macros that are expanded to paths enclosed in double quotes (%"c,
   %"C, %"f, %"F, %"b, %"d and %"D);
 - handle %m, %M, %s and %S in the :! command.

:set command and options:
 - removed 'savelocation' option. Use :set vifminfo+=dhistory;
 - added 'wildmenu', 'ignorecase', 'smartcase', 'hlsearch', 'vifminfo',
   'shell', 'vixcmd', 'scrolloff', 'timeoutlen', 'autochpos','gdefault',
   'slowfs' options;
 - added abbreviations for options;
 - added support for using ':' instead of '=';
 - support for ':set' and ':set all' commands;
 - made ':set option' equivalent to ':set option?' for all types of options
   except boolean;
 - made 'history' option control search, command line and prompt histories;
 - better 'sort' option (support by multiple sort keys, added iname key);
 - made 'vicmd' and 'vixcmd' understand & at the end;
 - :set command now understands & (reset option to its default value).

Color scheme related changes:
 - all color schemes are stored under the ~/.vifm/colors/ directory, each
   color scheme in its own file;
 - color scheme file is a list of commands. All command-line commands are
   handled, but only :highlight commands are really useful here;
 - added colors for current top line, other top line, status line, error
   messages in the status bar, broken links and FIFO files;
 - now maximum number of color schemes is unlimited even on 8-color terminals
   (there was a limit of 5 color schemes for such terminals before).

Only on Windows:
 - gl normal mode key;
 - UNC names support;
 - :volumes command.

For Vim:
 - added g:vifm_term variable for the plugin;
 - added vifmrc syntax and filetype files for Vim;
 - tags for some items in the help file for Vim.

Other changes:
 - let user go through directories with execute access, but no read access;
 - made filetype understand star as in globals;
 - removed duplicates from command and directory history;
 - made directory, command line and search histories as well as dirstack and
   registers persistent (when 'vifminfo' option contains appropriate value);
 - show search matches in the menus;
 - now keys can be used in mappings and mapping of keys like y, d or m works
   right;
 - modify terminal emulator title;
 - don't quit when terminal is too small (print message and ignore input);
 - fixed bugs.

Vifm-0.6.1 is available.
------------------------

Windows version remains unchanged for now.  I'm planning to use one code base
for both Unix and Windows platforms and it would take some time to do that.

Major changes since 0.5:
 - added support for user mappings;
 - added file selectors (like motions and text-objects);
 - improved sort dialog;
 - added filetype detection using GTK+ or libmagic (:file);
 - added directory stack (:pushd, :popd);
 - added completion for :! and :!! commands;
 - added custom file viewers (:view);
 - added startup file;
 - better utf8 support;
 - added :set command and options.

See ChangeLog for details.

==============

Vifm-0.5 is available.
----------------------

This release is mainly user contributed patches and a new port for Windows.
A filetype setting was added to allow the mounting of files with fuse-zip and
other filesystems based on fuse.  The :com input was changed to accept wide
characters.  The Windows port is missing some of the features of the Unix
version but it is useful and stable enough for an initial release.  The
following commands were added in the Windows port:
 - :copy;
 - :move;
 - :volume - list mounted volumes.
